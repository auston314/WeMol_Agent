Oxygen constitutes nearly one-half of the earth's crust and about 20% of the mass of the air. The weight percentage of oxygen on earth is 49.20% in the crust and 20% in the air.\n",

      "Answer: An empirical formula represents the relative numbers of a compound's elements in the simplest whole-number ratio, while a molecular formula indicates the actual number of each type of atom in a molecule. The molecular formula is derived by comparing the compound's molecular or molar mass to its empirical formula mass and adjusting the subscripts accordingly. For example, the empirical formula for glucose is CH₂O, representing the simplest ratio of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms, while the molecular formula is C₆H₁₂O₆, showing the actual number of atoms in a glucose molecule.\n",
