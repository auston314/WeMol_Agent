    "The chemical reactions that we have considered in previous chapters involve changes in the electronic structure of the species involved, that is, the arrangement of the electrons around atoms, ions, or molecules. Nuclear structure, the numbers of protons and neutrons within the nuclei of the atoms involved, remains unchanged during chemical reactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter will introduce the topic of nuclear chemistry, which began with the discovery of radioactivity in 1896 by French physicist Antoine Becquerel and has become increasingly important during the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, providing the basis for various technologies related to energy, medicine, geology, and many other areas.\n",

    "Nuclear chemistry is the study of reactions that involve changes in nuclear structure. The chapter on atoms, molecules, and ions introduced the basic idea of nuclear structure, that the nucleus of an atom is composed of protons and, with the exception of ${ }_{1}^{1} \\mathrm{H}$, neutrons. Recall that the number of protons in the nucleus is called the atomic number (Z) of the element, and the sum of the number of protons and the number of neutrons is the mass number (A). Atoms with the same atomic number but different mass numbers are isotopes of the same element. When referring to a single type of nucleus, we often use the term nuclide and identify it by the notation ${ }_{Z}^{A} X$, where $X$ is the symbol for the element, A is the mass number, and Z is the atomic number (for example, $\\left.{ }_{6}^{14} \\mathrm{C}\\right)$. Often a nuclide is referenced by the name of the element followed by a hyphen and the mass number. For example, ${ }_{6}^{14} \\mathrm{C}$ is called \"carbon-14.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Protons and neutrons, collectively called nucleons, are packed together tightly in a nucleus. With a radius of about $10^{-15}$ meters, a nucleus is quite small compared to the radius of the entire atom, which is about $10^{-10}$ meters. Nuclei are extremely dense compared to bulk matter, averaging $1.8 \\times 10^{14}$ grams per cubic centimeter. For example, water has a density of 1 gram per cubic centimeter, and iridium, one of the densest elements known, has a density of 22.6 $\\mathrm{g} / \\mathrm{cm}^{3}$. If the earth's density were equal to the average nuclear density, the earth's radius would be only about 200 meters (earth's actual radius is approximately $6.4 \\times 10^{6}$ meters, 30,000 times larger). Example 21.1 demonstrates just how great nuclear densities can be in the natural world.\n",

    "Neutron stars form when the core of a very massive star undergoes gravitational collapse, causing the star's outer layers to explode in a supernova.

    "To hold positively charged protons together in the very small volume of a nucleus requires very strong attractive forces because the positively charged protons repel one another strongly at such short distances. The force of attraction that holds the nucleus together is the strong nuclear force. (The strong force is one of the four fundamental forces that are known to exist. The others are the electromagnetic force, the gravitational force, and the nuclear weak force.) This force acts between protons, between neutrons, and between protons and neutrons. It is very different from the electrostatic force that holds negatively charged electrons around a positively charged nucleus (the attraction between opposite charges). Over distances less than $10^{-15}$ meters and within the nucleus, the strong nuclear force is much stronger than electrostatic repulsions between protons; over larger distances and outside the nucleus, it is essentially nonexistent.\n",

    "#### Nuclear Binding Energy\n",

    "As a simple example of the energy associated with the strong nuclear force, consider the helium atom composed of two protons, two neutrons, and two electrons. The total mass of these six subatomic particles may be calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",

    "However, mass spectrometric measurements reveal that the mass of an ${ }_{2}^{4} \\mathrm{He}$ atom is 4.0026 amu , less than the combined masses of its six constituent subatomic particles. This difference between the calculated and experimentally measured masses is known as the mass defect of the atom. In the case of helium, the mass defect indicates a \"loss\" in mass of $4.0331 \\mathrm{amu}-4.0026 \\mathrm{amu}=0.0305 \\mathrm{amu}$. The loss in mass accompanying the formation of an atom from protons, neutrons, and electrons is due to the conversion of that mass into energy that is evolved as the atom forms. The nuclear binding energy is the energy produced when the atoms' nucleons are bound together; this is also the energy needed to break a nucleus into its constituent protons and neutrons. In comparison to chemical bond\n",

This equation can be used to find the amount of energy that results when matter is converted into energy. Using this mass-energy equivalence equation, the nuclear binding energy of a nucleus may be calculated from its mass defect, as demonstrated in Example 21.2. A variety of units are commonly used for nuclear binding energies, including electron volts (eV), with 1 eV equaling the amount of energy necessary to the move the charge of an electron across an electric potential difference of 1 volt, making $1 \\mathrm{eV}=1.602 \\times 10^{-19} \\mathrm{~J}$.\n",

    "#### Nuclear Stability\n",
    "\n",
    "A nucleus is stable if it cannot be transformed into another configuration without adding energy from the outside. Of the thousands of nuclides that exist, about 250 are stable. A plot of the number of neutrons versus the number of protons for stable nuclei reveals that the stable isotopes fall into a narrow band. This region is known as the band of stability (also called the belt, zone, or valley of stability). The straight line in Figure 21.2 represents nuclei that have a 1:1 ratio of protons to neutrons (n:p ratio). Note that the lighter stable nuclei, in general, have equal numbers of protons and neutrons. For example, nitrogen-14 has seven protons and seven neutrons. Heavier stable nuclei, however, have increasingly more neutrons than protons. For example: iron-56 has 30 neutrons and 26 protons, an n:p ratio of 1.15 , whereas the stable nuclide lead-207 has 125 neutrons and 82 protons, an n:p ratio equal to 1.52. This is because larger nuclei have more proton-proton repulsions, and require larger numbers of neutrons to provide compensating strong forces to overcome these electrostatic repulsions and hold the nucleus together.\n",

    "![Image](Chapter_21_images/img-1.jpeg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 21.2 This plot shows the nuclides that are known to exist and those that are stable. The stable nuclides are indicated in blue, and the unstable nuclides are indicated in green. Note that all isotopes of elements with atomic numbers greater than 83 are unstable. The solid line is the line where $\\mathrm{n}=\\mathrm{Z}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The nuclei that are to the left or to the right of the band of stability are unstable and exhibit radioactivity. They change spontaneously (decay) into other nuclei that are either in, or closer to, the band of stability. These nuclear decay reactions convert one unstable isotope (or radioisotope) into another, more stable, isotope. We will discuss the nature and products of this radioactive decay in subsequent sections of this chapter.\n",

    "Several observations may be made regarding the relationship between the stability of a nucleus and its structure. Nuclei with even numbers of protons, neutrons, or both are more likely to be stable (see Table 21.1). Nuclei with\n",
    "\n",
    "certain numbers of nucleons, known as magic numbers, are stable against nuclear decay. These numbers of protons or neutrons ( $2,8,20,28,50,82$, and 126) make complete shells in the nucleus. These are similar in concept to the stable electron shells observed for the noble gases. Nuclei that have magic numbers of both protons and neutrons, such as ${ }_{4}^{4} \\mathrm{He},{ }_{8}^{16} \\mathrm{O},{ }_{20}^{40} \\mathrm{Ca}$, and ${ }_{82}^{208} \\mathrm{~Pb}$, are called \"double magic\" and are particularly stable. These trends in nuclear stability may be rationalized by considering a quantum mechanical model of nuclear energy states analogous to that used to describe electronic states earlier in this textbook.

    "\n",
    "#### Types of Particles in Nuclear Reactions\n",
    "\n",
    "Many entities can be involved in nuclear reactions. The most common are protons, neutrons, alpha particles, beta particles, positrons, and gamma rays, as shown in Figure 21.4. Protons $\\left({ }_{1}^{1} \\mathrm{p}\\right.$, also represented by the symbol ${ }_{1}^{1} \\mathrm{H}$ ) and neutrons $\\left({ }_{0}^{1} \\mathrm{n}\\right)$ are the constituents of atomic nuclei, and have been described previously. Alpha particles $\\left({ }_{2}^{4} \\mathrm{He}\\right.$, also represented by the symbol ${ }_{2}^{4} \\alpha$ ) are high-energy helium nuclei. Beta particles $\\left({ }_{-1}^{0} \\beta\\right.$, also represented by the symbol ${ }_{-1}^{0} \\mathrm{e}$ ) are high-energy electrons, and gamma rays are photons of very high-energy electromagnetic radiation. Positrons $\\left({ }_{+1}^{0}\\right.$ e, also represented by the symbol ${ }_{+1}^{0} \\beta$ ) are positively charged electrons (\"anti-electrons\"). The subscripts and superscripts are necessary for balancing nuclear equations, but are usually optional in other circumstances. For example, an alpha particle is a helium nucleus ( He ) with a charge of +2 and a mass number of 4 , so it is symbolized ${ }_{2}^{4} \\mathrm{He}$. This works because, in general, the ion charge is not important in the balancing of nuclear equations.\n",

    "Figure 21.4 Although many species are encountered in nuclear reactions, this table summarizes the names, symbols, representations, and descriptions of the most common of these.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that positrons are exactly like electrons, except they have the opposite charge. They are the most common example of antimatter, particles with the same mass but the opposite state of another property (for example, charge) than ordinary matter. When antimatter encounters ordinary matter, both are annihilated and their mass is converted into energy in the form of gamma rays ( $\\gamma$ )-and other much smaller subnuclear particles, which are beyond the scope of this chapter-according to the mass-energy equivalence equation $E=m c^{2}$, seen in the preceding section. For example, when a positron and an electron collide, both are annihilated and two gamma ray photons are created:\n",

    "\n",
    "As seen in the chapter discussing light and electromagnetic radiation, gamma rays compose short wavelength, highenergy electromagnetic radiation and are (much) more energetic than better-known X-rays that can behave as particles in the wave-particle duality sense. Gamma rays are a type of high energy electromagnetic radiation produced when a nucleus undergoes a transition from a higher to a lower energy state, similar to how a photon is produced by an electronic transition from a higher to a lower energy level. Due to the much larger energy differences between nuclear energy shells, gamma rays emanating from a nucleus have energies that are typically millions of times larger than electromagnetic radiation emanating from electronic transitions.\n",

    "#### Balancing Nuclear Reactions \n",

Among them were Marie Curie (the first woman to win a Nobel Prize, and the only person to win two Nobel Prizes in different sciences-chemistry and physics), who was the first to coin the term \"radioactivity,\" and Ernest Rutherford (of gold foil experiment fame), who investigated and named three of the most common types of radiation. During the beginning of the twentieth century, many radioactive substances were discovered, the properties of radiation were investigated and quantified, and a solid understanding of radiation and nuclear decay was developed.\n",

The unstable nuclide is called the parent nuclide; the nuclide that results from the decay is known as the daughter nuclide. The daughter nuclide may be stable, or it may decay itself. The radiation produced during radioactive decay is such that the daughter nuclide lies closer to the band of stability than the parent nuclide, so the location of a nuclide relative to the band of stability can serve as a guide to the kind of decay it will undergo (Figure 21.5).\n",

We classify different types of radioactive decay by the radiation produced.\n",

Beta particles, which are attracted to the positive plate and deflected a relatively large amount, must be negatively charged and relatively light. Gamma rays, which are unaffected by the electric field, must be uncharged.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alpha ( $\\alpha$ ) decay is the emission of an $\\alpha$ particle from the nucleus. For example, polonium-210 undergoes $\\alpha$ decay:\n",

Because the loss of an $\\alpha$ particle gives a daughter nuclide with a mass number four units smaller and an atomic number two units smaller than those of the parent nuclide, the daughter nuclide has a larger n:p ratio than the parent nuclide. If the parent nuclide undergoing $\\alpha$ decay lies below the band of stability (refer to Figure 21.2), the daughter nuclide will lie closer to the band.\n",

Emission of an electron does not change the mass number of the nuclide but does increase the number of its protons and decrease the number of its neutrons. Consequently, the n:p ratio is decreased, and the daughter nuclide lies closer to the band of stability than did the parent nuclide.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gamma emission ( $\\gamma$ emission) is observed when a nuclide is formed in an excited state and then decays to its ground state with the emission of a $\\gamma$ ray, a quantum of high-energy electromagnetic radiation.

    "Electron capture occurs when an inner shell electron combines with a proton and is converted into a neutron. The loss of an inner shell electron leaves a vacancy that will be filled by one of the outer electrons. As the outer electron drops into the vacancy, it will emit energy. In most cases, the energy emitted will be in the form of an X-ray. Like positron emission, electron capture occurs for \"proton-rich\" nuclei that lie below the band of stability. Electron capture has the same effect on the nucleus as does positron emission: The atomic number is decreased by one and the mass number does not change. This increases the n:p ratio, and the daughter nuclide lies closer to the band of stability than did the parent nuclide. Whether electron capture or positron emission occurs is difficult to predict. The choice is primarily due to kinetic factors, with the one requiring the smaller activation energy being the one more likely to occur.\n",

    "Positron emission tomography (PET) scans use radiation to diagnose and track health conditions and monitor medical treatments by revealing how parts of a patient's body function (Figure 21.8). To perform a PET scan, a positron-emitting radioisotope is produced in a cyclotron and then attached to a substance that is used by the part of the body being investigated. This \"tagged\" compound, or radiotracer, is then put into the patient (injected via IV or breathed in as a gas), and how it is used by the tissue reveals how that organ or other area of the body functions.\n",

    "\n",
    "For example, F-18 is produced by proton bombardment of ${ }^{18} \\mathrm{O}\\left({ }_{8}^{18} \\mathrm{O}+{ }_{1}^{1} \\mathrm{p} \\longrightarrow{ }_{9}^{18} \\mathrm{~F}+{ }_{0}^{1} \\mathrm{n}\\right)$ and incorporated into a glucose analog called fludeoxyglucose (FDG). How FDG is used by the body provides critical diagnostic information; for example, since cancers use glucose differently than normal tissues, FDG can reveal cancers. The ${ }^{18} \\mathrm{~F}$ emits positrons that interact with nearby electrons, producing a burst of gamma radiation. This energy is detected by the scanner and converted into a detailed, three-dimensional, color image that shows how that part of the patient's body functions. Different levels of gamma radiation produce different amounts of brightness and colors in the image, which can then be interpreted by a radiologist to reveal what is going on. PET scans can detect heart damage and heart disease, help diagnose Alzheimer's disease, indicate the part of a brain that is affected by epilepsy, reveal cancer, show what stage it is, and how much it has spread, and whether treatments are effective. Unlike magnetic resonance imaging and X-rays, which only show how something looks, the big advantage of PET scans is that they show how something functions. PET scans are now usually performed in conjunction with a computed tomography scan.\n",

    "#### Radioactive Decay Series\n",
    "\n",
    "The naturally occurring radioactive isotopes of the heaviest elements fall into chains of successive disintegrations, or decays, and all the species in one chain constitute a radioactive family, or radioactive decay series. Three of these series include most of the naturally radioactive elements of the periodic table. They are the uranium series, the actinide series, and the thorium series. The neptunium series is a fourth series, which is no longer significant on the earth because of the short half-lives of the species involved. Each series is characterized by a parent (first member) that has a long half-life and a series of daughter nuclides that ultimately lead to a stable end-product-that is, a nuclide on the band of stability (Figure 21.9). In all three series, the end-product is a stable isotope of lead. The neptunium series, previously thought to terminate with bismuth-209, terminates with thallium-205.\n",

    "\n",
    "Radioactive decay follows first-order kinetics. Since first-order reactions have already been covered in detail in the kinetics chapter, we will now apply those concepts to nuclear decay reactions. Each radioactive nuclide has a characteristic, constant half-life $\\left(t_{1 / 2}\\right)$, the time required for half of the atoms in a sample to decay. An isotope's halflife allows us to determine how long a sample of a useful isotope will be available, and how long a sample of an undesirable or dangerous isotope must be stored before it decays to a low-enough radiation level that is no longer a problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, cobalt-60, an isotope that emits gamma rays used to treat cancer, has a half-life of 5.27 years (Figure 21.10). In a given cobalt-60 source, since half of the ${ }_{22}^{60} \\mathrm{Co}$ nuclei decay every 5.27 years, both the amount of material and the intensity of the radiation emitted is cut in half every 5.27 years. (Note that for a given substance, the intensity of radiation that it produces is directly proportional to the rate of decay of the substance and the amount of the substance.) This is as expected for a process following first-order kinetics. Thus, a cobalt-60 source that is used for cancer treatment must be replaced regularly to continue to be effective.\n",

The accuracy of a straightforward application of this technique depends on the ${ }_{6}^{14} \\mathrm{C}:{ }_{6}^{12} \\mathrm{C}$ ratio in a living plant being the same now as it was in an earlier era, but this is not always valid. Due to the increasing accumulation of $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ molecules (largely $\\left.{ }_{6}^{12} \\mathrm{CO}_{2}\\right)$ in the atmosphere caused by combustion of fossil fuels (in which essentially all of the ${ }_{6}^{14} \\mathrm{C}$ has decayed), the ratio of ${ }_{6}^{14} \\mathrm{C}:{ }_{6}^{12} \\mathrm{C}$ in the atmosphere may be changing. This manmade increase in ${ }_{6}^{12} \\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ in the atmosphere causes the ${ }_{6}^{14} \\mathrm{C}:{ }_{6}^{12} \\mathrm{C}$ ratio to decrease, and this in turn affects the ratio in currently living organisms on the earth. Fortunately, however, we can use other data, such as tree dating via examination of annual growth rings, to calculate correction factors. With these correction factors, accurate dates can be determined. In general, radioactive dating only works for about 10 half-lives; therefore, the limit for carbon-14 dating is about 57,000 years.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Radioactive Dating Using Nuclides Other than Carbon-14 \n",
    "\n",
    "Radioactive dating can also use other radioactive nuclides with longer half-lives to date older events. For example, uranium-238 (which decays in a series of steps into lead-206) can be used for establishing the age of rocks (and the approximate age of the oldest rocks on earth). Since U-238 has a half-life of 4.5 billion years, it takes that amount of time for half of the original U-238 to decay into $\\mathrm{Pb}-206$. In a sample of rock that does not contain appreciable amounts of $\\mathrm{Pb}-208$, the most abundant isotope of lead, we can assume that lead was not present when the rock was formed. Therefore, by measuring and analyzing the ratio of U-238:Pb-206, we can determine the age of the rock. This assumes that all of the lead-206 present came from the decay of uranium-238. If there is additional lead-206 present, which is indicated by the presence of other lead isotopes in the sample, it is necessary to make an adjustment. Potassium-argon dating uses a similar method. K-40 decays by positron emission and electron capture to form Ar-40 with a half-life of 1.25 billion years. If a rock sample is crushed and the amount of Ar- 40 gas that escapes is measured, determination of the Ar-40:K-40 ratio yields the age of the rock. Other methods, such as rubidium-strontium dating (Rb-87 decays into Sr-87 with a half-life of 48.8 billion years), operate on the same principle. To estimate the lower limit for the earth's age, scientists determine the age of various rocks and minerals, making the assumption that the earth is older than the oldest rocks and minerals in its crust. As of 2014, the oldest known rocks on earth are the Jack Hills zircons from Australia, found by uranium-lead dating to be almost 4.4 billion years old.\n",

    "Many heavier elements with smaller binding energies per nucleon can decompose into more stable elements that have intermediate mass numbers and larger binding energies per nucleon-that is, mass numbers and binding energies per nucleon that are closer to the \"peak\" of the binding energy graph near 56 (see Figure 21.3). Sometimes neutrons are also produced. This decomposition is called fission, the breaking of a large nucleus into smaller pieces. The breaking is rather random with the formation of a large number of different products. Fission usually does not occur naturally, but is induced by bombardment with neutrons. The first reported nuclear fission occurred in 1939 when three German scientists, Lise Meitner, Otto Hahn, and Fritz Strassman, bombarded uranium-235 atoms with slow-moving neutrons that split the U-238 nuclei into smaller fragments that consisted of several neutrons and elements near the middle of the periodic table. Since then, fission has been observed in many other isotopes, including most actinide isotopes that have an odd number of neutrons. A typical nuclear fission reaction is shown in Figure 21.14.\n",

    "Among the products of Meitner, Hahn, and Strassman's fission reaction were barium, krypton, lanthanum, and cerium, all of which have nuclei that are more stable than uranium-235. Since then, hundreds of different isotopes have been observed among the products of fissionable substances. A few of the many reactions that occur for U-235, and a graph showing the distribution of its fission products and their yields, are shown in Figure 21.15. Similar fission reactions have been observed with other uranium isotopes, as well as with a variety of other isotopes such as those of plutonium.\n",

Nuclear fission reactions produce incredibly large amounts of energy compared to chemical reactions.

    "\n",
    "As described earlier, when undergoing fission U-235 produces two \"medium-sized\" nuclei, and two or three neutrons. These neutrons may then cause the fission of other uranium-235 atoms, which in turn provide more neutrons that can cause fission of even more nuclei, and so on. If this occurs, we have a nuclear chain reaction (see Figure 21.16). On the other hand, if too many neutrons escape the bulk material without interacting with a nucleus, then no chain reaction will occur.\n",

    "\n",
    "Figure 21.16 The fission of a large nucleus, such as U-235, produces two or three neutrons, each of which is capable of causing fission of another nucleus by the reactions shown. If this process continues, a nuclear chain reaction occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Material that can sustain a nuclear fission chain reaction is said to be fissile or fissionable. (Technically, fissile material can undergo fission with neutrons of any energy, whereas fissionable material requires high-energy neutrons.) Nuclear fission becomes self-sustaining when the number of neutrons produced by fission equals or exceeds the number of neutrons absorbed by splitting nuclei plus the number that escape into the surroundings. The amount of a fissionable material that will support a self-sustaining chain reaction is a critical mass. An amount of fissionable material that cannot sustain a chain reaction is a subcritical mass. An amount of material in which there is an increasing rate of fission is known as a supercritical mass. The critical mass depends on the type of material:\n",
    "\n",
    "its purity, the temperature, the shape of the sample, and how the neutron reactions are controlled (Figure 21.17).\n",
    "\n",
    "![Image](Chapter_21_images/img-19.jpeg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 21.17 (a) In a subcritical mass, the fissile material is too small and allows too many neutrons to escape the material, so a chain reaction does not occur. (b) In a critical mass, a large enough number of neutrons in the fissile material induce fission to create a chain reaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "An atomic bomb (Figure 21.18) contains several pounds of fissionable material, ${ }_{92}^{235} \\mathrm{U}$ or ${ }_{94}^{239} \\mathrm{Pu}$, a source of neutrons, and an explosive device for compressing it quickly into a small volume. When fissionable material is in small pieces, the proportion of neutrons that escape through the relatively large surface area is great, and a chain reaction does not take place. When the small pieces of fissionable material are brought together quickly to form a body with a mass larger than the critical mass, the relative number of escaping neutrons decreases, and a chain reaction and explosion result.\n",

    "Figure 21.18 (a) The nuclear fission bomb that destroyed Hiroshima on August 6, 1945, consisted of two subcritical masses of U-235, where conventional explosives were used to fire one of the subcritical masses into the other, creating the critical mass for the nuclear explosion. (b) The plutonium bomb that destroyed Nagasaki on August 9, 1945, consisted of a hollow sphere of plutonium that was rapidly compressed by conventional explosives. This led to a concentration of plutonium in the center that was greater than the critical mass necessary for the nuclear explosion.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Fission Reactors \n",
    "\n",
    "Chain reactions of fissionable materials can be controlled and sustained without an explosion in a nuclear reactor (Figure 21.19). Any nuclear reactor that produces power via the fission of uranium or plutonium by bombardment with neutrons must have at least five components: nuclear fuel consisting of fissionable material, a nuclear moderator, reactor coolant, control rods, and a shield and containment system. We will discuss these components in greater detail later in the section. The reactor works by separating the fissionable nuclear material such that a critical mass cannot be formed, controlling both the flux and absorption of neutrons to allow shutting down the fission reactions. In a nuclear reactor used for the production of electricity, the energy released by fission reactions is trapped as thermal energy and used to boil water and produce steam. The steam is used to turn a turbine, which powers a generator for the production of electricity.\n",

    "Figure 21.19 (a) The Diablo Canyon Nuclear Power Plant near San Luis Obispo is the only nuclear power plant currently in operation in California. The domes are the containment structures for the nuclear reactors, and the brown building houses the turbine where electricity is generated. Ocean water is used for cooling. (b) The Diablo Canyon uses a pressurized water reactor, one of a few different fission reactor designs in use around the world, to produce electricity. Energy from the nuclear fission reactions in the core heats water in a closed, pressurized system. Heat from this system produces steam that drives a turbine, which in turn produces electricity.

    "\n",
    "#### Nuclear Fuels \n",
    "\n",
    "Nuclear fuel consists of a fissionable isotope, such as uranium-235, which must be present in sufficient quantity to provide a self-sustaining chain reaction. In the United States, uranium ores contain from $0.05-0.3 \\%$ of the uranium oxide $\\mathrm{U}_{3} \\mathrm{O}_{8}$; the uranium in the ore is about $99.3 \\%$ nonfissionable U-238 with only $0.7 \\%$ fissionable U-235. Nuclear reactors require a fuel with a higher concentration of U-235 than is found in nature; it is normally enriched to have about $5 \\%$ of uranium mass as U-235. At this concentration, it is not possible to achieve the supercritical mass necessary for a nuclear explosion. Uranium can be enriched by gaseous diffusion (the only method currently used in the US), using a gas centrifuge, or by laser separation.\n",
    "In the gaseous diffusion enrichment plant where U-235 fuel is prepared, $\\mathrm{UF}_{6}$ (uranium hexafluoride) gas at low pressure moves through barriers that have holes just barely large enough for $\\mathrm{UF}_{6}$ to pass through. The slightly lighter ${ }^{235} \\mathrm{UF}_{6}$ molecules diffuse through the barrier slightly faster than the heavier ${ }^{238} \\mathrm{UF}_{6}$ molecules. This process is repeated through hundreds of barriers, gradually increasing the concentration of ${ }^{235} \\mathrm{UF}_{6}$ to the level needed by the nuclear reactor. The basis for this process, Graham's law, is described in the chapter on gases. The enriched $\\mathrm{UF}_{6}$ gas is collected, cooled until it solidifies, and then taken to a fabrication facility where it is made into fuel assemblies. Each fuel assembly consists of fuel rods that contain many thimble-sized, ceramic-encased, enriched uranium (usually $\\mathrm{UO}_{2}$ ) fuel pellets. Modern nuclear reactors may contain as many as 10 million fuel pellets. The amount of energy in each of these pellets is equal to that in almost a ton of coal or 150 gallons of oil.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Nuclear Moderators\n",
    "\n",
    "Neutrons produced by nuclear reactions move too fast to cause fission (refer back to Figure 21.17). They must first be slowed to be absorbed by the fuel and produce additional nuclear reactions. A nuclear moderator is a substance that slows the neutrons to a speed that is low enough to cause fission. Early reactors used high-purity graphite as a moderator. Modern reactors in the US exclusively use heavy water $\\left(\\frac{3}{1} \\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O}\\right)$ or light water (ordinary $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O}$ ), whereas\n",
    "\n",
    "some reactors in other countries use other materials, such as carbon dioxide, beryllium, or graphite.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Reactor Coolants \n",
    "\n",
    "A nuclear reactor coolant is used to carry the heat produced by the fission reaction to an external boiler and turbine, where it is transformed into electricity. Two overlapping coolant loops are often used; this counteracts the transfer of radioactivity from the reactor to the primary coolant loop. All nuclear power plants in the US use water as a coolant. Other coolants include molten sodium, lead, a lead-bismuth mixture, or molten salts.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Control Rods\n",
    "\n",
    "Nuclear reactors use control rods (Figure 21.20) to control the fission rate of the nuclear fuel by adjusting the number of slow neutrons present to keep the rate of the chain reaction at a safe level. Control rods are made of boron, cadmium, hafnium, or other elements that are able to absorb neutrons. Boron-10, for example, absorbs neutrons by a reaction that produces lithium-7 and alpha particles:\n",
    "\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "When control rod assemblies are inserted into the fuel element in the reactor core, they absorb a larger fraction of the slow neutrons, thereby slowing the rate of the fission reaction and decreasing the power produced. Conversely, if the control rods are removed, fewer neutrons are absorbed, and the fission rate and energy production increase. In an emergency, the chain reaction can be shut down by fully inserting all of the control rods into the nuclear core between the fuel rods.\n",

    "#### Shield and Containment System \n",
    "\n",
    "During its operation, a nuclear reactor produces neutrons and other radiation. Even when shut down, the decay products are radioactive. In addition, an operating reactor is thermally very hot, and high pressures result from the circulation of water or another coolant through it. Thus, a reactor must withstand high temperatures and pressures, and must protect operating personnel from the radiation. Reactors are equipped with a containment system (or shield) that consists of three parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The reactor vessel, a steel shell that is 3-20-centimeters thick and, with the moderator, absorbs much of the radiation produced by the reactor\n",
    "2. A main shield of 1-3 meters of high-density concrete\n",
    "3. A personnel shield of lighter materials that protects operators from $\\gamma$ rays and X-rays\n",

The following Chemistry in Everyday Life feature explores three infamous meltdown incidents.\n",

    "**Nuclear Accidents**\n",
    "\n",
    "The importance of cooling and containment are amply illustrated by three major accidents that occurred with the nuclear reactors at nuclear power generating stations in the United States (Three Mile Island), the former Soviet Union (Chernobyl), and Japan (Fukushima).\n",
    "\n",
    "In March 1979, the cooling system of the Unit 2 reactor at Three Mile Island Nuclear Generating Station in Pennsylvania failed, and the cooling water spilled from the reactor onto the floor of the containment building. After the pumps stopped, the reactors overheated due to the high radioactive decay heat produced in the first few days after the nuclear reactor shut down. The temperature of the core climbed to at least $2200^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$, and the upper portion of the core began to melt. In addition, the zirconium alloy cladding of the fuel rods began to react with steam and produced hydrogen:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathrm{Zr}(s)+2 \\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O}(g) \\longrightarrow \\mathrm{ZrO}_{2}(s)+2 \\mathrm{H}_{2}(g)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The hydrogen accumulated in the confinement building, and it was feared that there was danger of an explosion of the mixture of hydrogen and air in the building. Consequently, hydrogen gas and radioactive gases (primarily krypton and xenon) were vented from the building. Within a week, cooling water circulation was restored and the core began to cool. The plant was closed for nearly 10 years during the cleanup process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although zero discharge of radioactive material is desirable, the discharge of radioactive krypton and xenon, such as occurred at the Three Mile Island plant, is among the most tolerable. These gases readily disperse in the atmosphere and thus do not produce highly radioactive areas. Moreover, they are noble gases and are not incorporated into plant and animal matter in the food chain. Effectively none of the heavy elements of the core of the reactor were released into the environment, and no cleanup of the area outside of the containment building was necessary (Figure 21.21).\n",
    "\n",
    "![Image](Chapter_21_images/img-23.jpeg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 21.21 (a) In this 2010 photo of Three Mile Island, the remaining structures from the damaged Unit 2 reactor are seen on the left, whereas the separate Unit 1 reactor, unaffected by the accident, continues generating power to this day (right). (b) President Jimmy Carter visited the Unit 2 control room a few days after the accident in 1979.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another major nuclear accident involving a reactor occurred in April 1986, at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant in Ukraine, which was still a part of the former Soviet Union. While operating at low power during an unauthorized experiment with some of its safety devices shut off, one of the reactors at the plant became unstable. Its chain reaction became uncontrollable and increased to a level far beyond what the reactor was designed for. The steam pressure in the reactor rose to between 100 and 500 times the full power pressure and ruptured the reactor. Because the reactor was not enclosed in a containment building, a large amount of radioactive material spewed out, and additional fission products were released, as the graphite (carbon) moderator of the core ignited and burned. The fire was controlled, but over 200 plant workers and firefighters developed acute radiation sickness and at least 32 soon died from the effects of the radiation. It is predicted that about 4000 more deaths will occur among emergency workers and former Chernobyl residents from radiation-induced cancer and leukemia. The reactor has since been encapsulated in steel and concrete, a now-decaying structure known as the sarcophagus. Almost 30 years later, significant radiation problems still persist in the area, and Chernobyl largely remains a wasteland.\n",
    "In 2011, the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant in Japan was badly damaged by a 9.0-magnitude earthquake and resulting tsunami. Three reactors up and running at the time were shut down automatically, and emergency generators came online to power electronics and coolant systems. However, the tsunami quickly flooded the emergency generators and cut power to the pumps that circulated coolant water through the reactors. High-temperature steam in the reactors reacted with zirconium alloy to produce hydrogen gas. The gas escaped into the containment building, and the mixture of hydrogen and air exploded. Radioactive material was released from the containment vessels as the result of deliberate venting to reduce the hydrogen pressure, deliberate discharge of coolant water into the sea, and accidental or uncontrolled events.\n",
    "An evacuation zone around the damaged plant extended over 12.4 miles away, and an estimated 200,000 people were evacuated from the area. All 48 of Japan's nuclear power plants were subsequently shut down, remaining shuttered as of December 2014. Since the disaster, public opinion has shifted from largely favoring to largely opposing increasing the use of nuclear power plants, and a restart of Japan's atomic energy program is still stalled (Figure 21.22).\n",

    "The energy produced by a reactor fueled with enriched uranium results from the fission of uranium as well as from the fission of plutonium produced as the reactor operates. As discussed previously, the plutonium forms from the combination of neutrons and the uranium in the fuel. In any nuclear reactor, only about $0.1 \\%$ of the mass of the fuel is converted into energy. The other $99.9 \\%$ remains in the fuel rods as fission products and unused fuel. All of the fission products absorb neutrons, and after a period of several months to a few years, depending on the reactor, the fission products must be removed by changing the fuel rods. Otherwise, the concentration of these fission products would increase and absorb more neutrons until the reactor could no longer operate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Spent fuel rods contain a variety of products, consisting of unstable nuclei ranging in atomic number from 25 to 60 , some transuranium elements, including plutonium and americium, and unreacted uranium isotopes. The unstable nuclei and the transuranium isotopes give the spent fuel a dangerously high level of radioactivity. The long-lived isotopes require thousands of years to decay to a safe level. The ultimate fate of the nuclear reactor as a significant source of energy in the United States probably rests on whether or not a politically and scientifically satisfactory technique for processing and storing the components of spent fuel rods can be developed.\n",

    "#### Nuclear Fusion and Fusion Reactors\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of converting very light nuclei into heavier nuclei is also accompanied by the conversion of mass into large amounts of energy, a process called fusion. The principal source of energy in the sun is a net fusion reaction in which four hydrogen nuclei fuse and produce one helium nucleus and two positrons. This is a net reaction of a more complicated series of events:\n",

    "\n",
    "energy during the fusion. This reaction produces about $3.6 \\times 10^{11} \\mathrm{~kJ}$ of energy per mole of ${ }_{2}^{4} \\mathrm{He}$ produced. This is somewhat larger than the energy produced by the nuclear fission of one mole of U-235 ( $1.8 \\times 10^{10} \\mathrm{~kJ}$ ), and over 3 million times larger than the energy produced by the (chemical) combustion of one mole of octane ( 5471 kJ ).\n",
    "It has been determined that the nuclei of the heavy isotopes of hydrogen, a deuteron, ${ }_{1}^{2}$ and a triton, ${ }_{1}^{3}$, undergo fusion at extremely high temperatures (thermonuclear fusion). They form a helium nucleus and a neutron:\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "This change proceeds with a mass loss of 0.0188 amu , corresponding to the release of $1.69 \\times 10^{9}$ kilojoules per mole of ${ }_{2}^{4} \\mathrm{He}$ formed. The very high temperature is necessary to give the nuclei enough kinetic energy to overcome the very strong repulsive forces resulting from the positive charges on their nuclei so they can collide.\n",
    "Useful fusion reactions require very high temperatures for their initiation-about $15,000,000 \\mathrm{~K}$ or more. At these temperatures, all molecules dissociate into atoms, and the atoms ionize, forming plasma. These conditions occur in an extremely large number of locations throughout the universe-stars are powered by fusion. Humans have already figured out how to create temperatures high enough to achieve fusion on a large scale in thermonuclear weapons. A thermonuclear weapon such as a hydrogen bomb contains a nuclear fission bomb that, when exploded, gives off enough energy to produce the extremely high temperatures necessary for fusion to occur.\n",
    "Another much more beneficial way to create fusion reactions is in a fusion reactor, a nuclear reactor in which fusion reactions of light nuclei are controlled. Because no solid materials are stable at such high temperatures, mechanical devices cannot contain the plasma in which fusion reactions occur. Two techniques to contain plasma at the density and temperature necessary for a fusion reaction are currently the focus of intensive research efforts: containment by a magnetic field and by the use of focused laser beams (Figure 21.23). A number of large projects are working to attain one of the biggest goals in science: getting hydrogen fuel to ignite and produce more energy than the amount supplied to achieve the extremely high temperatures and pressures that are required for fusion. At the time of this writing, there are no self-sustaining fusion reactors operating in the world, although small-scale controlled fusion reactions have been run for very brief periods.\n",

    "### 21.5 Uses of Radioisotopes \n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this section, you will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- List common applications of radioactive isotopes\n",
    "\n",
    "Radioactive isotopes have the same chemical properties as stable isotopes of the same element, but they emit radiation, which can be detected. If we replace one (or more) atom(s) with radioisotope(s) in a compound, we can track them by monitoring their radioactive emissions. This type of compound is called a radioactive tracer (or radioactive label). Radioisotopes are used to follow the paths of biochemical reactions or to determine how a substance is distributed within an organism. Radioactive tracers are also used in many medical applications, including both diagnosis and treatment. They are used to measure engine wear, analyze the geological formation around oil wells, and much more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Radioisotopes have revolutionized medical practice (see Appendix M), where they are used extensively. Over 10 million nuclear medicine procedures and more than 100 million nuclear medicine tests are performed annually in the United States. Four typical examples of radioactive tracers used in medicine are technetium-99 ( ${ }_{45}^{99} \\mathrm{Tc}$ ), thallium-201 $\\left({ }_{81}^{201} \\mathrm{Tl}\\right)$, iodine-131 ( ${ }_{33}^{131} \\mathrm{I}$ ), and sodium-24 ( ${ }_{11}^{24} \\mathrm{Na}$ ). Damaged tissues in the heart, liver, and lungs absorb certain compounds of technetium-99 preferentially. After it is injected, the location of the technetium compound, and hence the damaged tissue, can be determined by detecting the $\\gamma$ rays emitted by the Tc-99 isotope. Thallium-201 (Figure 21.24) becomes concentrated in healthy heart tissue, so the two isotopes, Tc-99 and Tl-201, are used together to study heart tissue. Iodine-131 concentrates in the thyroid gland, the liver, and some parts of the brain. It can therefore be used to monitor goiter and treat thyroid conditions, such as Grave's disease, as well as liver and brain tumors. Salt solutions containing compounds of sodium-24 are injected into the bloodstream to help locate obstructions to the flow of blood.\n",

    "Radioisotopes used in medicine typically have short half-lives-for example, the ubiquitous Tc-99m has a half-life of\n",

Mo-99 undergoes $\\beta$ decay with a half-life of 66 hours, and the Tc-99 is then chemically extracted (Figure 21.25). The parent nuclide Mo-99 is part of a molybdate ion, $\\mathrm{MoO}_{4}{ }^{2-}$; when it decays, it forms the pertechnetate ion, $\\mathrm{TcO}_{4}{ }^{-}$. These two water-soluble ions are separated by column chromatography, with the higher charge molybdate ion adsorbing onto the alumina in the column, and the lower charge pertechnetate ion passing through the column in the solution. A few micrograms of Mo-99 can produce enough Tc-99 to perform as many as 10,000 tests.\n",

Radiation therapy is the use of high-energy radiation to damage the DNA of cancer cells, which kills them or keeps them from dividing (Figure 21.26). A cancer patient may receive external beam radiation therapy delivered by a machine outside the body, or internal radiation therapy (brachytherapy) from a radioactive substance that has been introduced into the body. Note that chemotherapy is similar to internal radiation therapy in that the cancer treatment is injected into the body, but differs in that chemotherapy uses chemical rather than radioactive substances to kill the cancer cells.\n",

    "Commercial applications of radioactive materials are equally diverse (Figure 21.28). They include determining the thickness of films and thin metal sheets by exploiting the penetration power of various types of radiation. Flaws in metals used for structural purposes can be detected using high-energy gamma rays from cobalt-60 in a fashion similar to the way X-rays are used to examine the human body. In one form of pest control, flies are controlled by sterilizing male flies with $y$ radiation so that females breeding with them do not produce offspring. Many foods are preserved by radiation that kills microorganisms that cause the foods to spoil.\n",

    "The increased use of radioisotopes has led to increased concerns over the effects of these materials on biological systems (such as humans). All radioactive nuclides emit high-energy particles or electromagnetic waves. When this radiation encounters living cells, it can cause heating, break chemical bonds, or ionize molecules. The most serious biological damage results when these radioactive emissions fragment or ionize molecules. For example, alpha and beta particles emitted from nuclear decay reactions possess much higher energies than ordinary chemical bond energies. When these particles strike and penetrate matter, they produce ions and molecular fragments that are extremely reactive. The damage this does to biomolecules in living organisms can cause serious malfunctions in normal cell processes, taxing the organism's repair mechanisms and possibly causing illness or even death (Figure 21.30).\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Ionizing and Nonionizing Radiation\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a large difference in the magnitude of the biological effects of nonionizing radiation (for example, light and microwaves) and ionizing radiation, emissions energetic enough to knock electrons out of molecules (for example, $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ particles, $\\gamma$ rays, X-rays, and high-energy ultraviolet radiation) (Figure 21.31).\n",

    "Energy absorbed from nonionizing radiation speeds up the movement of atoms and molecules, which is equivalent to heating the sample. Although biological systems are sensitive to heat (as we might know from touching a hot stove or spending a day at the beach in the sun), a large amount of nonionizing radiation is necessary before dangerous levels are reached. Ionizing radiation, however, may cause much more severe damage by breaking bonds or removing electrons in biological molecules, disrupting their structure and function. The damage can also be done indirectly, by first ionizing $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O}$ (the most abundant molecule in living organisms), which forms a $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O}^{+}$ion that reacts with water, forming a hydronium ion and a hydroxyl radical:\n",

    "Because the hydroxyl radical has an unpaired electron, it is highly reactive. (This is true of any substance with unpaired electrons, known as a free radical.)

Examples of direct and indirect damage are shown in Figure 21.32.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Biological Effects of Exposure to Radiation \n",
    "\n",
    "Radiation can harm either the whole body (somatic damage) or eggs and sperm (genetic damage). Its effects are more pronounced in cells that reproduce rapidly, such as the stomach lining, hair follicles, bone marrow, and embryos. This is why patients undergoing radiation therapy often feel nauseous or sick to their stomach, lose hair, have bone aches, and so on, and why particular care must be taken when undergoing radiation therapy during pregnancy.\n",
    "Different types of radiation have differing abilities to pass through material (Figure 21.33). A very thin barrier, such as a sheet or two of paper, or the top layer of skin cells, usually stops alpha particles. Because of this, alpha particle sources are usually not dangerous if outside the body, but are quite hazardous if ingested or inhaled (see the Chemistry in Everyday Life feature on Radon Exposure). Beta particles will pass through a hand, or a thin layer of material like paper or wood, but are stopped by a thin layer of metal. Gamma radiation is very penetrating and can pass through a thick layer of most materials. Some high-energy gamma radiation is able to pass through a few feet of concrete. Certain dense, high atomic number elements (such as lead) can effectively attenuate gamma radiation with thinner material and are used for shielding. The ability of various kinds of emissions to cause ionization varies greatly, and some particles have almost no tendency to produce ionization. Alpha particles have about twice the ionizing power of fast-moving neutrons, about 10 times that of $\\beta$ particles, and about 20 times that of $\\gamma$ rays and X-rays.\n",

    "**Radon Exposure**\n",
    "\n",
    "For many people, one of the largest sources of exposure to radiation is from radon gas (Rn-222). Radon-222 is an $\\alpha$ emitter with a half-life of 3.82 days. It is one of the products of the radioactive decay series of U-238 (Figure 21.9), which is found in trace amounts in soil and rocks. The radon gas that is produced slowly escapes from the ground and gradually seeps into homes and other structures above. Since it is about eight times more dense than air, radon gas accumulates in basements and lower floors, and slowly diffuses throughout buildings (Figure 21.34).\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Figure 21.34 Radon-222 seeps into houses and other buildings from rocks that contain uranium-238, a radon emitter. The radon enters through cracks in concrete foundations and basement floors, stone or porous cinderblock foundations, and openings for water and gas pipes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Radon is found in buildings across the country, with amounts depending on where you live. The average concentration of radon inside houses in the US ( $1.25 \\mathrm{pCi} / \\mathrm{L}$ ) is about three times the levels found in outside air, and about one in six houses have radon levels high enough that remediation efforts to reduce the radon concentration are recommended. Exposure to radon increases one's risk of getting cancer (especially lung cancer), and high radon levels can be as bad for health as smoking a carton of cigarettes a day. Radon is the number one cause of lung cancer in nonsmokers and the second leading cause of lung cancer overall. Radon exposure is believed to cause over 20,000 deaths in the US per year.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Measuring Radiation Exposure \n",
    "\n",
    "Several different devices are used to detect and measure radiation, including Geiger counters, scintillation counters (scintillators), and radiation dosimeters (Figure 21.35). Probably the best-known radiation instrument, the Geiger counter (also called the Geiger-Müller counter) detects and measures radiation. Radiation causes the ionization of the gas in a Geiger-Müller tube. The rate of ionization is proportional to the amount of radiation. A scintillation counter contains a scintillator-a material that emits light (luminesces) when excited by ionizing radiation-and a sensor that converts the light into an electric signal. Radiation dosimeters also measure ionizing radiation and are often used\n",
    "\n",
    "to determine personal radiation exposure. Commonly used types are electronic, film badge, thermoluminescent, and quartz fiber dosimeters.\n",

    "\n",
    "A variety of units are used to measure various aspects of radiation (Figure 21.36). The SI unit for rate of radioactive decay is the becquerel (Bq), with $1 \\mathrm{~Bq}=1$ disintegration per second. The curie (Ci) and millicurie (mCi) are much larger units and are frequently used in medicine ( 1 curie $=1 \\mathrm{Ci}=3.7 \\times 10^{10}$ disintegrations per second). The SI unit for measuring radiation dose is the gray (Gy), with $1 \\mathrm{~Gy}=1 \\mathrm{~J}$ of energy absorbed per kilogram of tissue. In medical applications, the radiation absorbed dose (rad) is more often used ( $1 \\mathrm{rad}=0.01 \\mathrm{~Gy} ; 1 \\mathrm{rad}$ results in the absorption of $0.01 \\mathrm{~J} / \\mathrm{kg}$ of tissue). The SI unit measuring tissue damage caused by radiation is the sievert (Sv). This takes into account both the energy and the biological effects of the type of radiation involved in the radiation dose. The roentgen equivalent for man (rem) is the unit for radiation damage that is used most frequently in medicine ( $100 \\mathrm{rem}=1 \\mathrm{~Sv}$ ). Note that the tissue damage units (rem or Sv ) includes the energy of the radiation dose (rad or Gy) along with a biological factor referred to as the RBE (for relative biological effectiveness) that is an approximate measure of the relative damage done by the radiation.

    "\n",
    "#### 21.1 Nuclear Structure and Stability\n",
    "\n",
    "An atomic nucleus consists of protons and neutrons, collectively called nucleons. Although protons repel each other, the nucleus is held tightly together by a short-range, but very strong, force called the strong nuclear force. A nucleus has less mass than the total mass of its constituent nucleons. This \"missing\" mass is the mass defect, which has been converted into the binding energy that holds the nucleus together according to Einstein's mass-energy equivalence equation, $E=m c^{2}$. Of the many nuclides that exist, only a small number are stable. Nuclides with even numbers of protons or neutrons, or those with magic numbers of nucleons, are especially likely to be stable. These stable nuclides occupy a narrow band of stability on a graph of number of protons versus number of neutrons. The binding energy per nucleon is largest for the elements with mass numbers near 56; these are the most stable nuclei.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 21.2 Nuclear Equations\n",
    "\n",
    "Nuclei can undergo reactions that change their number of protons, number of neutrons, or energy state. Many different particles can be involved in nuclear reactions. The most common are protons, neutrons, positrons (which are positively charged electrons), alpha ( $\\alpha$ ) particles (which are high-energy helium nuclei), beta ( $\\beta$ ) particles (which are high-energy electrons), and gamma ( $\\gamma$ ) rays (which compose high-energy electromagnetic radiation). As with chemical reactions, nuclear reactions are always balanced. When a nuclear reaction occurs, the total mass (number) and the total charge remain unchanged.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 21.3 Radioactive Decay\n",
    "\n",
    "Nuclei that have unstable n:p ratios undergo spontaneous radioactive decay. The most common types of radioactivity are $\\alpha$ decay, $\\beta$ decay, $\\gamma$ emission, positron emission, and electron capture. Nuclear reactions also often involve $\\gamma$ rays, and some nuclei decay by electron capture. Each of these modes of decay leads to the formation of a new nucleus with a more stable n:p ratio. Some substances undergo radioactive decay series, proceeding through multiple decays before ending in a stable isotope. All nuclear decay processes follow first-order kinetics, and each radioisotope has its own characteristic half-life, the time that is required for half of its atoms to decay. Because of the large differences in stability among nuclides, there is a very wide range of half-lives of radioactive substances. Many of these substances have found useful applications in medical diagnosis and treatment, determining the age of archaeological and geological objects, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 21.4 Transmutation and Nuclear Energy\n",
    "\n",
    "It is possible to produce new atoms by bombarding other atoms with nuclei or high-speed particles. The products of these transmutation reactions can be stable or radioactive. A number of artificial elements, including technetium, astatine, and the transuranium elements, have been produced in this way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nuclear power as well as nuclear weapon detonations can be generated through fission (reactions in which a heavy nucleus is split into two or more lighter nuclei and several neutrons). Because the neutrons may induce additional fission reactions when they combine with other heavy nuclei, a chain reaction can result. Useful power is obtained if the fission process is carried out in a nuclear reactor. The conversion of light nuclei into heavier nuclei (fusion) also produces energy. At present, this energy has not been contained adequately and is too expensive to be feasible for commercial energy production.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 21.5 Uses of Radioisotopes\n",
    "\n",
    "Compounds known as radioactive tracers can be used to follow reactions, track the distribution of a substance, diagnose and treat medical conditions, and much more. Other radioactive substances are helpful for controlling pests, visualizing structures, providing fire warnings, and for many other applications. Hundreds of millions of nuclear\n",
    "\n",
    "medicine tests and procedures, using a wide variety of radioisotopes with relatively short half-lives, are performed every year in the US. Most of these radioisotopes have relatively short half-lives; some are short enough that the radioisotope must be made on-site at medical facilities. Radiation therapy uses high-energy radiation to kill cancer cells by damaging their DNA. The radiation used for this treatment may be delivered externally or internally.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 21.6 Biological Effects of Radiation \n",
    "\n",
    "We are constantly exposed to radiation from a variety of naturally occurring and human-produced sources. This radiation can affect living organisms. Ionizing radiation is the most harmful because it can ionize molecules or break chemical bonds, which damages the molecule and causes malfunctions in cell processes. It can also create reactive hydroxyl radicals that damage biological molecules and disrupt physiological processes. Radiation can cause somatic or genetic damage, and is most harmful to rapidly reproducing cells. Types of radiation differ in their ability to penetrate material and damage tissue, with alpha particles the least penetrating but potentially most damaging and gamma rays the most penetrating.\n",
    "Various devices, including Geiger counters, scintillators, and dosimeters, are used to detect and measure radiation, and monitor radiation exposure. We use several units to measure radiation: becquerels or curies for rates of radioactive decay; gray or rads for energy absorbed; and rems or sieverts for biological effects of radiation. Exposure to radiation can cause a wide range of health effects, from minor to severe, and including death. We can minimize the effects of radiation by shielding with dense materials such as lead, moving away from the source, and limiting time of exposure.\n",
