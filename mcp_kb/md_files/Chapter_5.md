**Introduction**

Chemical reactions, such as those that occur when you light a match, involve changes in energy as well as matter. Societies at all levels of development could not function without the energy released by chemical reactions. In 2012, about $85 \%$ of US energy consumption came from the combustion of petroleum products, coal, wood, and garbage. We use this energy to produce electricity (38\%); to transport food, raw materials, manufactured goods, and people (27\%); for industrial production ( $21 \%$ ); and to heat and power our homes and businesses ( $10 \%$ ). ${ }^{111}$ While these combustion reactions help us meet our essential energy needs, they are also recognized by the majority of the scientific community as a major contributor to global climate change.
Useful forms of energy are also available from a variety of chemical reactions other than combustion. For example, the energy produced by the batteries in a cell phone, car, or flashlight results from chemical reactions. This chapter introduces many of the basic ideas necessary to explore the relationships between chemical changes and energy, with a focus on thermal energy.

### 5.1 Energy Basics 

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

- Define energy, distinguish types of energy, and describe the nature of energy changes that accompany chemical and physical changes
- Distinguish the related properties of heat, thermal energy, and temperature
- Define and distinguish specific heat and heat capacity, and describe the physical implications of both
- Perform calculations involving heat, specific heat, and temperature change

Chemical changes and their accompanying changes in energy are important parts of our everyday world (Figure 5.2). The macronutrients in food (proteins, fats, and carbohydrates) undergo metabolic reactions that provide the energy to keep our bodies functioning. We burn a variety of fuels (gasoline, natural gas, coal) to produce energy for transportation, heating, and the generation of electricity. Industrial chemical reactions use enormous amounts of energy to produce raw materials (such as iron and aluminum). Energy is then used to manufacture those raw materials into useful products, such as cars, skyscrapers, and bridges.

Over $90 \%$ of the energy we use comes originally from the sun. Every day, the sun provides the earth with almost 10,000 times the amount of energy necessary to meet all of the world's energy needs for that day. Our challenge is to find ways to convert and store incoming solar energy so that it can be used in reactions or chemical processes that are both convenient and nonpolluting. Plants and many bacteria capture solar energy through photosynthesis. We release the energy stored in plants when we burn wood or plant products such as ethanol. We also use this energy to fuel our bodies by eating food that comes directly from plants or from animals that got their energy by eating plants. Burning coal and petroleum also releases stored solar energy: These fuels are fossilized plant and animal matter.

This chapter will introduce the basic ideas of an important area of science concerned with the amount of heat absorbed or released during chemical and physical changes-an area called thermochemistry. The concepts introduced in this chapter are widely used in almost all scientific and technical fields. Food scientists use them to determine the energy content of foods. Biologists study the energetics of living organisms, such as the metabolic combustion of sugar into carbon dioxide and water. The oil, gas, and transportation industries, renewable energy providers, and many others endeavor to find better methods to produce energy for our commercial and personal needs. Engineers strive to improve energy efficiency, find better ways to heat and cool our homes, refrigerate our food and drinks, and meet the energy and cooling needs of computers and electronics, among other applications. Understanding thermochemical principles is essential for chemists, physicists, biologists, geologists, every type of engineer, and just about anyone

who studies or does any kind of science.

#### Energy 

Energy can be defined as the capacity to supply heat or do work. One type of work (w) is the process of causing matter to move against an opposing force. For example, we do work when we inflate a bicycle tire-we move matter (the air in the pump) against the opposing force of the air already in the tire.

Like matter, energy comes in different types. One scheme classifies energy into two types: potential energy, the energy an object has because of its relative position, composition, or condition, and kinetic energy, the energy that an object possesses because of its motion. Water at the top of a waterfall or dam has potential energy because of its position; when it flows downward through generators, it has kinetic energy that can be used to do work and produce electricity in a hydroelectric plant (Figure 5.3). A battery has potential energy because the chemicals within it can produce electricity that can do work.
![Image](Chapter_5_images/img-2.jpeg)

Figure 5.3 (a) Water at a higher elevation, for example, at the top of Victoria Falls, has a higher potential energy than water at a lower elevation. As the water falls, some of its potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. (b) If the water flows through generators at the bottom of a dam, such as the Hoover Dam shown here, its kinetic energy is converted into electrical energy.

Energy can be converted from one form into another, but all of the energy present before a change occurs always exists in some form after the change is completed. This observation is expressed in the law of conservation of energy: during a chemical or physical change, energy can be neither created nor destroyed, although it can be changed in form. (This is also one version of the first law of thermodynamics, as you will learn later.)

When one substance is converted into another, there is always an associated conversion of one form of energy into another. Heat is usually released or absorbed, but sometimes the conversion involves light, electrical energy, or some other form of energy. For example, chemical energy (a type of potential energy) is stored in the molecules that compose gasoline. When gasoline is combusted within the cylinders of a car's engine, the rapidly expanding gaseous products of this chemical reaction generate mechanical energy (a type of kinetic energy) when they move the cylinders' pistons.

According to the law of conservation of matter (seen in an earlier chapter), there is no detectable change in the total amount of matter during a chemical change. When chemical reactions occur, the energy changes are relatively modest and the mass changes are too small to measure, so the laws of conservation of matter and energy hold well. However, in nuclear reactions, the energy changes are much larger (by factors of a million or so), the mass changes are measurable, and matter-energy conversions are significant. This will be examined in more detail in a later chapter

on nuclear chemistry.

#### Thermal Energy, Temperature, and Heat 

Thermal energy is kinetic energy associated with the random motion of atoms and molecules. Temperature is a quantitative measure of "hot" or "cold." When the atoms and molecules in an object are moving or vibrating quickly, they have a higher average kinetic energy (KE), and we say that the object is "hot." When the atoms and molecules are moving slowly, they have lower average KE, and we say that the object is "cold" (Figure 5.4). Assuming that no chemical reaction or phase change (such as melting or vaporizing) occurs, increasing the amount of thermal energy in a sample of matter will cause its temperature to increase. And, assuming that no chemical reaction or phase change (such as condensation or freezing) occurs, decreasing the amount of thermal energy in a sample of matter will cause its temperature to decrease.

Most substances expand as their temperature increases and contract as their temperature decreases. This property can be used to measure temperature changes, as shown in Figure 5.5. The operation of many thermometers depends on the expansion and contraction of substances in response to temperature changes.

![Image](Chapter_5_images/img-4.jpeg)

Figure 5.5 (a) In an alcohol or mercury thermometer, the liquid (dyed red for visibility) expands when heated and contracts when cooled, much more so than the glass tube that contains the liquid. (b) In a bimetallic thermometer, two different metals (such as brass and steel) form a two-layered strip. When heated or cooled, one of the metals (brass) expands or contracts more than the other metal (steel), causing the strip to coil or uncoil. Both types of thermometers have a calibrated scale that indicates the temperature. (credit a: modification of work by "dwstucke"/Flickr)

The following demonstration (http://openstaxcollege.org/1/16Bimetallic) allows one to view the effects of heating and cooling a coiled bimetallic strip.

Heat (q) is the transfer of thermal energy between two bodies at different temperatures. Heat flow (a redundant term, but one commonly used) increases the thermal energy of one body and decreases the thermal energy of the other. Suppose we initially have a high temperature (and high thermal energy) substance $(\mathrm{H})$ and a low temperature (and low thermal energy) substance ( L ). The atoms and molecules in H have a higher average KE than those in L . If we place substance H in contact with substance L , the thermal energy will flow spontaneously from substance H to substance L . The temperature of substance H will decrease, as will the average KE of its molecules; the temperature of substance L will increase, along with the average KE of its molecules. Heat flow will continue until the two substances are at the same temperature (Figure 5.6).

![Image](Chapter_5_images/img-5.jpeg)

Figure 5.6 (a) Substances H and L are initially at different temperatures, and their atoms have different average kinetic energies. (b) When they contact each other, collisions between the molecules result in the transfer of kinetic (thermal) energy from the hotter to the cooler matter. (c) The two objects reach "thermal equilibrium" when both substances are at the same temperature and their molecules have the same average kinetic energy.

Matter undergoing chemical reactions and physical changes can release or absorb heat. A change that releases heat is called an exothermic process. For example, the combustion reaction that occurs when using an oxyacetylene torch is an exothermic process-this process also releases energy in the form of light as evidenced by the torch's flame (Figure 5.7). A reaction or change that absorbs heat is an endothermic process. A cold pack used to treat muscle strains provides an example of an endothermic process. When the substances in the cold pack (water and a salt like ammonium nitrate) are brought together, the resulting process absorbs heat, leading to the sensation of cold.

The sparks are tiny bits of the molten metal flying away. (b) A cold pack uses an endothermic process to create the sensation of cold.

Historically, energy was measured in units of calories (cal). A calorie is the amount of energy required to raise one gram of water by 1 degree $C$ ( 1 kelvin). However, this quantity depends on the atmospheric pressure and the starting temperature of the water. The ease of measurement of energy changes in calories has meant that the calorie is still frequently used. The Calorie (with a capital C), or large calorie, commonly used in quantifying food energy content, is a kilocalorie. The SI unit of heat, work, and energy is the joule. A joule (J) is defined as the amount of energy used when a force of 1 newton moves an object 1 meter. It is named in honor of the English physicist James Prescott Joule. One joule is equivalent to $1 \mathrm{~kg} \mathrm{~m}^{2} / \mathrm{s}^{2}$, which is also called 1 newton-meter. A kilojoule ( kJ ) is 1000 joules. To standardize its definition, 1 calorie has been set to equal 4.184 joules.

We now introduce two concepts useful in describing heat flow and temperature change. The heat capacity (C) of a body of matter is the quantity of heat $(q)$ it absorbs or releases when it experiences a temperature change $(\Delta T)$ of 1 degree Celsius (or equivalently, 1 kelvin):

$$
C=\frac{q}{\Delta T}
$$

Heat capacity is determined by both the type and amount of substance that absorbs or releases heat. It is therefore an extensive property-its value is proportional to the amount of the substance.

For example, consider the heat capacities of two cast iron frying pans. The heat capacity of the large pan is five times greater than that of the small pan because, although both are made of the same material, the mass of the large pan is five times greater than the mass of the small pan. More mass means more atoms are present in the larger pan, so it takes more energy to make all of those atoms vibrate faster. The heat capacity of the small cast iron frying pan is found by observing that it takes $18,150 \mathrm{~J}$ of energy to raise the temperature of the pan by $50.0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ :

$$
C_{\text {small pan }}=\frac{18,140 \mathrm{~J}}{50.0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}}=363 \mathrm{~J} /{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}
$$

The larger cast iron frying pan, while made of the same substance, requires $90,700 \mathrm{~J}$ of energy to raise its temperature by $50.0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. The larger pan has a (proportionally) larger heat capacity because the larger amount of material requires a (proportionally) larger amount of energy to yield the same temperature change:

$$
C_{\text {large pan }}=\frac{90,700 \mathrm{~J}}{50.0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}}=1814 \mathrm{~J} /{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}
$$

The specific heat capacity (c) of a substance, commonly called its "specific heat," is the quantity of heat required to raise the temperature of 1 gram of a substance by 1 degree Celsius (or 1 kelvin):

$$
c=\frac{q}{m \Delta T}
$$

Specific heat capacity depends only on the kind of substance absorbing or releasing heat. It is an intensive property-the type, but not the amount, of the substance is all that matters. For example, the small cast iron frying pan has a mass of 808 g . The specific heat of iron (the material used to make the pan) is therefore:

$$
c_{\text {iron }}=\frac{18,140 \mathrm{~J}}{(808 \mathrm{~g})\left(50.0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)}=0.449 \mathrm{~J} / \mathrm{g}^{\circ} \mathrm{C}
$$

The large frying pan has a mass of 4040 g . Using the data for this pan, we can also calculate the specific heat of iron:

$$
c_{\text {iron }}=\frac{90,700 \mathrm{~J}}{(4040 \mathrm{~g})\left(50.0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)}=0.449 \mathrm{~J} / \mathrm{g}^{\circ} \mathrm{C}
$$

Although the large pan is more massive than the small pan, since both are made of the same material, they both yield the same value for specific heat (for the material of construction, iron). Note that specific heat is measured in units of energy per temperature per mass and is an intensive property, being derived from a ratio of two extensive properties (heat and mass). The molar heat capacity, also an intensive property, is the heat capacity per mole of a particular substance and has units of $\mathrm{J} / \mathrm{mol}{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ (Figure 5.8).
![Image](Chapter_5_images/img-7.jpeg)

Figure 5.8 Because of its larger mass, a large frying pan has a larger heat capacity than a small frying pan. Because they are made of the same material, both frying pans have the same specific heat. (credit: Mark Blaser)
water has a relatively high specific heat (about $4.2 \mathrm{~J} / \mathrm{g}{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ for the liquid and $2.09 \mathrm{~J} / \mathrm{g}{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ for the solid)); most metals have much lower specific heats (usually less than $1 \mathrm{~J} / \mathrm{g}{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ ). The specific heat of a substance varies somewhat with temperature. However, this variation is usually small enough that we will treat specific heat as constant over the range of temperatures that will be considered in this chapter. Specific heats of some common substances are listed in Table 5.1.

Table 5.1 Specific Heats of Common Substances at $25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ and 1 bar

| Substance | Symbol (state) | Specific Heat $\left(\mathrm{J} / \mathrm{g}{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)$ |
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
| helium | $\mathrm{He}(g)$ | 5.193 |
| water | $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}(l)$ | 4.184 |
| ethanol | $\mathrm{C}_{2} \mathrm{H}_{6} \mathrm{O}(l)$ | 2.376 |
| ice | $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}(s)$ | $2.093\left(\right.$ at $\left.-10^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)$ |
| water vapor | $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}(\mathrm{g})$ | 1.864 |
| nitrogen | $\mathrm{N}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})$ | 1.040 |
| air |  | 1.007 |
| oxygen | $\mathrm{O}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})$ | 0.918 |
| aluminum | $\mathrm{Al}(\mathrm{s})$ | 0.897 |
| carbon dioxide | $\mathrm{CO}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})$ | 0.853 |
| argon | $\operatorname{Ar}(\mathrm{g})$ | 0.522 |
| iron | $\mathrm{Fe}(\mathrm{s})$ | 0.449 |
| copper | $\mathrm{Cu}(\mathrm{s})$ | 0.385 |
| lead | $\mathrm{Pb}(\mathrm{s})$ | 0.130 |
| gold | $\mathrm{Au}(\mathrm{s})$ | 0.129 |
| silicon | $\mathrm{Si}(\mathrm{s})$ | 0.712 |

If we know the mass of a substance and its specific heat, we can determine the amount of heat, $q$, entering or leaving the substance by measuring the temperature change before and after the heat is gained or lost:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& q=(\text { specific hea }) \times(\text { mass of substance }) \times(\text { temperature change }) \\
& q=c \times m \times \Delta T=c \times m \times\left(T_{\text {final }}-T_{\text {initial }}\right)
\end{aligned}
$$

In this equation, $c$ is the specific heat of the substance, $m$ is its mass, and $\Delta T$ (which is read "delta T") is the temperature change, $T_{\text {final }}-T_{\text {initial }}$. If a substance gains thermal energy, its temperature increases, its final temperature is higher than its initial temperature, $T_{\text {final }}-T_{\text {initial }}$ has a positive value, and the value of $q$ is positive. If a substance loses thermal energy, its temperature decreases, the final temperature is lower than the initial temperature, $T_{\text {final }}-$ $T_{\text {initial }}$ has a negative value, and the value of $q$ is negative.

#### Example 5.1 

**Measuring Heat**

A flask containing $8.0 \times 10^{2} \mathrm{~g}$ of water is heated, and the temperature of the water increases from $21^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ to $85^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. How much heat did the water absorb?

**Solution**

To answer this question, consider these factors:

- the specific heat of the substance being heated (in this case, water)
- the amount of substance being heated (in this case, $8.0 \times 10^{2} \mathrm{~g}$ )
- the magnitude of the temperature change (in this case, from $21^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ to $85^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ ).

The specific heat of water is $4.184 \mathrm{~J} / \mathrm{g}{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, so to heat 1 g of water by $1^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ requires 4.184 J . We note that since 4.184 J is required to heat 1 g of water by $1^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, we will need 800 times as much to heat $8.0 \times 10^{2} \mathrm{~g}$ of water by $1^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. Finally, we observe that since 4.184 J are required to heat 1 g of water by $1^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, we will need

64 times as much to heat it by $64^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ (that is, from $21^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ to $85^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ ).
This can be summarized using the equation:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& q=c \times m \times \Delta T=c \times m \times\left(T_{\text {fina }}-T_{\text {initial }}\right) \\
= & \left(4.184 \mathrm{~J} / \mathrm{g}^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right) \times\left(8.0 \times 10^{2} \mathrm{~g}\right) \times(85-21)^{\circ} \mathrm{C} \\
= & \left(4.184 \mathrm{~J} / \mathrm{g}^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right) \times\left(8.0 \times 10^{2} \mathrm{~g}\right) \times(64)^{\circ} \mathrm{C} \\
= & 210,000 \mathrm{~J}\left(=2.1 \times 10^{2} \mathrm{~kJ}\right)
\end{aligned}
$$

Because the temperature increased, the water absorbed heat and $q$ is positive.

**Check Your Learning** 

How much heat, in joules, must be added to a $5.07 \times 10^{4} \mathrm{~J}$ iron skillet to increase its temperature from 25 ${ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ to $250^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ ? The specific heat of iron is $0.449 \mathrm{~J} / \mathrm{g}^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$.

Answer: $5.07 \times 10^{4} \mathrm{~J}$
Note that the relationship between heat, specific heat, mass, and temperature change can be used to determine any of these quantities (not just heat) if the other three are known or can be deduced.

#### Example 5.2

**Determining Other Quantities**

A piece of unknown metal weighs 348 g . When the metal piece absorbs 6.64 kJ of heat, its temperature increases from $22.4^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ to $43.6^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. Determine the specific heat of this metal (which might provide a clue to its identity).

**Solution**

Since mass, heat, and temperature change are known for this metal, we can determine its specific heat using the relationship:

$$
q=c \times m \times \Delta T=c \times m \times\left(T_{\text {fina }}-T_{\text {initial }}\right)
$$

Substituting the known values:

$$
6640 \mathrm{~J}=c \times(348 \mathrm{~g}) \times(43.6-22.4)^{\circ} \mathrm{C}
$$

Solving:

$$
c=\frac{6640 \mathrm{~J}}{(348 \mathrm{~g}) \times\left(21.2^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)}=0.900 \mathrm{~J} / \mathrm{g}^{\circ} \mathrm{C}
$$

Comparing this value with the values in Table 5.1, this value matches the specific heat of aluminum, which suggests that the unknown metal may be aluminum.

**Check Your Learning**

A piece of unknown metal weighs 217 g . When the metal piece absorbs 1.43 kJ of heat, its temperature increases from $24.5^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ to $39.1^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. Determine the specific heat of this metal, and predict its identity.

Answer: $c=0.451 \mathrm{~J} / \mathrm{g}^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$; the metal is likely to be iron

#### Chemistry in Everyday Life 

**Solar Thermal Energy Power Plants**

The sunlight that reaches the earth contains thousands of times more energy than we presently capture. Solar thermal systems provide one possible solution to the problem of converting energy from the sun into energy we can use. Large-scale solar thermal plants have different design specifics, but all concentrate sunlight to heat some substance; the heat "stored" in that substance is then converted into electricity.

The Solana Generating Station in Arizona's Sonora Desert produces 280 megawatts of electrical power. It uses parabolic mirrors that focus sunlight on pipes filled with a heat transfer fluid (HTF) (Figure 5.9). The HTF then does two things: It turns water into steam, which spins turbines, which in turn produces electricity, and it melts and heats a mixture of salts, which functions as a thermal energy storage system. After the sun goes down, the molten salt mixture can then release enough of its stored heat to produce steam to run the turbines for 6 hours. Molten salts are used because they possess a number of beneficial properties, including high heat capacities and thermal conductivities.

The 377-megawatt Ivanpah Solar Generating System, located in the Mojave Desert in California, is the largest solar thermal power plant in the world (Figure 5.10). Its 170,000 mirrors focus huge amounts of sunlight on three water-filled towers, producing steam at over $538^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ that drives electricity-producing turbines. It produces enough energy to power 140,000 homes. Water is used as the working fluid because of its large heat capacity and heat of vaporization.

### 5.2 Calorimetry 

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

- Explain the technique of calorimetry
- Calculate and interpret heat and related properties using typical calorimetry data

One technique we can use to measure the amount of heat involved in a chemical or physical process is known as calorimetry. Calorimetry is used to measure amounts of heat transferred to or from a substance. To do so, the heat is exchanged with a calibrated object (calorimeter). The temperature change measured by the calorimeter is used to derive the amount of heat transferred by the process under study. The measurement of heat transfer using this approach requires the definition of a system (the substance or substances undergoing the chemical or physical change) and its surroundings (all other matter, including components of the measurement apparatus, that serve to either provide heat to the system or absorb heat from the system).

A calorimeter is a device used to measure the amount of heat involved in a chemical or physical process. For example, when an exothermic reaction occurs in solution in a calorimeter, the heat produced by the reaction is absorbed by the solution, which increases its temperature. When an endothermic reaction occurs, the heat required is absorbed from the thermal energy of the solution, which decreases its temperature (Figure 5.11). The temperature change, along with the specific heat and mass of the solution, can then be used to calculate the amount of heat involved in either case.

![Image](Chapter_5_images/img-10.jpeg)

Figure 5.11 In a calorimetric determination, either (a) an exothermic process occurs and heat, $q$, is negative, indicating that thermal energy is transferred from the system to its surroundings, or (b) an endothermic process occurs and heat, $q$, is positive, indicating that thermal energy is transferred from the surroundings to the system.

Scientists use well-insulated calorimeters that all but prevent the transfer of heat between the calorimeter and its environment, which effectively limits the "surroundings" to the nonsystem components with the calorimeter (and the calorimeter itself). This enables the accurate determination of the heat involved in chemical processes, the energy content of foods, and so on. General chemistry students often use simple calorimeters constructed from polystyrene cups (Figure 5.12). These easy-to-use "coffee cup" calorimeters allow more heat exchange with the outside environment, and therefore produce less accurate energy values.

![Image](Chapter_5_images/img-11.jpeg)

Figure 5.12 A simple calorimeter can be constructed from two polystyrene cups. A thermometer and stirrer extend through the cover into the reaction mixture.

Commercial solution calorimeters are also available. Relatively inexpensive calorimeters often consist of two thinwalled cups that are nested in a way that minimizes thermal contact during use, along with an insulated cover, handheld stirrer, and simple thermometer. More expensive calorimeters used for industry and research typically have a well-insulated, fully enclosed reaction vessel, motorized stirring mechanism, and a more accurate temperature sensor (Figure 5.13).

![Image](Chapter_5_images/img-12.jpeg)

Figure 5.13 Commercial solution calorimeters range from (a) simple, inexpensive models for student use to (b) expensive, more accurate models for industry and research.

Before discussing the calorimetry of chemical reactions, consider a simpler example that illustrates the core idea behind calorimetry. Suppose we initially have a high-temperature substance, such as a hot piece of metal (M), and a low-temperature substance, such as cool water (W). If we place the metal in the water, heat will flow from M to W . The temperature of $M$ will decrease, and the temperature of $W$ will increase, until the two substances have the same temperature-that is, when they reach thermal equilibrium (Figure 5.14). If this occurs in a calorimeter, ideally all of this heat transfer occurs between the two substances, with no heat gained or lost by either its external environment. Under these ideal circumstances, the net heat change is zero:

$$
q_{\text {substance } \mathrm{M}}+q_{\text {substance } \mathrm{W}}=0
$$

This relationship can be rearranged to show that the heat gained by substance $M$ is equal to the heat lost by substance W:

$$
q_{\text {substance } \mathrm{M}}=-q_{\text {substance } \mathrm{W}}
$$

The magnitude of the heat (change) is therefore the same for both substances, and the negative sign merely shows that $q_{\text {substance } \mathrm{M}}$ and $q_{\text {substance } \mathrm{W}}$ are opposite in direction of heat flow (gain or loss) but does not indicate the arithmetic sign of either $q$ value (that is determined by whether the matter in question gains or loses heat, per definition). In the specific situation described, $q_{\text {substance } \mathrm{M}}$ is a negative value and $q_{\text {substance } \mathrm{W}}$ is positive, since heat is transferred from M to W .

Figure 5.14 In a simple calorimetry process, (a) heat, $q$, is transferred from the hot metal, $M$, to the cool water, $W$, until (b) both are at the same temperature.

#### Example 5.3 

**Heat Transfer between Substances at Different Temperatures**

A $360.0-\mathrm{g}$ piece of rebar (a steel rod used for reinforcing concrete) is dropped into 425 mL of water at $24.0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. The final temperature of the water was measured as $42.7^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. Calculate the initial temperature of the piece of rebar. Assume the specific heat of steel is approximately the same as that for iron (Table 5.1), and that all heat transfer occurs between the rebar and the water (there is no heat exchange with the surroundings).

**Solution**

The temperature of the water increases from $24.0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ to $42.7^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, so the water absorbs heat. That heat came from the piece of rebar, which initially was at a higher temperature. Assuming that all heat transfer was between the rebar and the water, with no heat "lost" to the outside environment, then heat given off by rebar $=-$ heat taken in by water, or:

$$
q_{\text {rebar }}=-q_{\text {water }}
$$

Since we know how heat is related to other measurable quantities, we have:

$$
(c \times m \times \Delta T)_{\text {rebar }}=-(c \times m \times \Delta T)_{\text {water }}
$$

Letting $\mathrm{f}=$ final and $\mathrm{i}=$ initial, in expanded form, this becomes:

$$
c_{\text {rebar }} \times m_{\text {rebar }} \times\left(T_{\mathrm{f}, \text { rebar }}-T_{\mathrm{i}, \text { rebar }}\right)=-c_{\text {water }} \times m_{\text {water }} \times\left(T_{\mathrm{f}, \text { water }}-T_{\mathrm{i}, \text { water }}\right)
$$

The density of water is $1.0 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{mL}$, so 425 mL of water $=425 \mathrm{~g}$. Noting that the final temperature of both the rebar and water is $42.7^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, substituting known values yields:

$$
\begin{gathered}
\left(0.449 \mathrm{~J} / \mathrm{g}{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)(360.0 \mathrm{~g})\left(42.7^{\circ} \mathrm{C}-T_{\mathrm{i}, \text { rebar }}\right)=-\left(4.184 \mathrm{~J} / \mathrm{g}{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)(425 \mathrm{~g})\left(42.7^{\circ} \mathrm{C}-24.0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right) \\
T_{i, \text { rebar }}=\frac{\left(4.184 \mathrm{~J} / \mathrm{g}{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)(425 \mathrm{~g})\left(42.7^{\circ} \mathrm{C}-24.0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)}{\left(0.449 \mathrm{~J} / \mathrm{g}{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)(360.0 \mathrm{~g})}+42.7^{\circ} \mathrm{C}
\end{gathered}
$$

Solving this gives $T_{\mathrm{i}, \text { rebar }}=248^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, so the initial temperature of the rebar was $248^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$.

A 248-g piece of copper initially at $314^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ is dropped into 390 mL of water initially at $22.6^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. Assuming that all heat transfer occurs between the copper and the water, calculate the final temperature.

Answer: The final temperature (reached by both copper and water) is $38.7^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$.
This method can also be used to determine other quantities, such as the specific heat of an unknown metal.

#### Example 5.4

**Identifying a Metal by Measuring Specific Heat**

A 59.7 g piece of metal that had been submerged in boiling water was quickly transferred into 60.0 mL of water initially at $22.0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. The final temperature is $28.5^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. Use these data to determine the specific heat of the metal. Use this result to identify the metal.

**Solution**

Assuming perfect heat transfer, heat given off by metal $=-$ heat taken in by water, or:

$$
q_{\text {metal }}=-q_{\text {water }}
$$

In expanded form, this is:

$$
c_{\text {metal }} \times m_{\text {metal }} \times\left(T_{\mathrm{f}, \text { metal }}-T_{\mathrm{i}, \text { metal }}\right)=-c_{\text {water }} \times m_{\text {water }} \times\left(T_{\mathrm{f}, \text { water }}-T_{\mathrm{i}, \text { water }}\right)
$$

Noting that since the metal was submerged in boiling water, its initial temperature was $100.0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$; and that for water, $60.0 \mathrm{~mL}=60.0 \mathrm{~g}$; we have:

$$
\left(c_{\text {metal }}\right)(59.7 \mathrm{~g})\left(28.5^{\circ} \mathrm{C}-100.0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)=-\left(4.18 \mathrm{~J} / \mathrm{g}^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)(60.0 \mathrm{~g})\left(28.5^{\circ} \mathrm{C}-22.0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)
$$

Solving this:

$$
c_{\text {metal }}=\frac{-\left(4.184 \mathrm{~J} / \mathrm{g}^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)(60.0 \mathrm{~g})\left(6.5^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)}{(59.7 \mathrm{~g})\left(-71.5^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)}=0.38 \mathrm{~J} / \mathrm{g}^{\circ} \mathrm{C}
$$

Comparing this with values in Table 5.1, our experimental specific heat is closest to the value for copper $\left(0.39 \mathrm{~J} / \mathrm{g}{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)$, so we identify the metal as copper.

**Check Your Learning**

A 92.9-g piece of a silver/gray metal is heated to $178.0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, and then quickly transferred into 75.0 mL of water initially at $24.0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. After 5 minutes, both the metal and the water have reached the same temperature: $29.7^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. Determine the specific heat and the identity of the metal. (Note: You should find that the specific heat is close to that of two different metals. Explain how you can confidently determine the identity of the metal).

Answer: $c_{\text {metal }}=0.13 \mathrm{~J} / \mathrm{g}{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ This specific heat is close to that of either gold or lead. It would be difficult to

determine which metal this was based solely on the numerical values. However, the observation that the metal is silver/gray in addition to the value for the specific heat indicates that the metal is lead.

When we use calorimetry to determine the heat involved in a chemical reaction, the same principles we have been discussing apply. The amount of heat absorbed by the calorimeter is often small enough that we can neglect it (though not for highly accurate measurements, as discussed later), and the calorimeter minimizes energy exchange with the outside environment. Because energy is neither created nor destroyed during a chemical reaction, the heat produced or consumed in the reaction (the "system"), $q_{\text {reaction }}$, plus the heat absorbed or lost by the solution (the "surroundings"), $q_{\text {solution }}$, must add up to zero:

$$
q_{\text {reaction }}+q_{\text {solution }}=0
$$

This means that the amount of heat produced or consumed in the reaction equals the amount of heat absorbed or lost by the solution:

$$
q_{\text {reaction }}=-q_{\text {solution }}
$$

This concept lies at the heart of all calorimetry problems and calculations.

#### Example 5.5 

**Heat Produced by an Exothermic Reaction**

When 50.0 mL of $1.00 \mathrm{M} \mathrm{HCl}(a q)$ and 50.0 mL of $1.00 \mathrm{M} \mathrm{NaOH}(a q)$, both at $22.0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, are added to a coffee cup calorimeter, the temperature of the mixture reaches a maximum of $28.9^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. What is the approximate amount of heat produced by this reaction?

$$
\mathrm{HCl}(a q)+\mathrm{NaOH}(a q) \longrightarrow \mathrm{NaCl}(a q)+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}(l)
$$

**Solution**

To visualize what is going on, imagine that you could combine the two solutions so quickly that no reaction took place while they mixed; then after mixing, the reaction took place. At the instant of mixing, you have 100.0 mL of a mixture of HCl and NaOH at $22.0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. The HCl and NaOH then react until the solution temperature reaches $28.9^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$.

The heat given off by the reaction is equal to that taken in by the solution. Therefore:

$$
q_{\text {reaction }}=-q_{\text {solution }}
$$

(It is important to remember that this relationship only holds if the calorimeter does not absorb any heat from the reaction, and there is no heat exchange between the calorimeter and the outside environment.)

Next, we know that the heat absorbed by the solution depends on its specific heat, mass, and temperature change:

$$
q_{\text {solution }}=(c \times m \times \Delta T)_{\text {solution }}
$$

To proceed with this calculation, we need to make a few more reasonable assumptions or approximations. Since the solution is aqueous, we can proceed as if it were water in terms of its specific heat and mass values. The density of water is approximately $1.0 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{mL}$, so 100.0 mL has a mass of about $1.0 \times 10^{2} \mathrm{~g}$ (two significant figures). The specific heat of water is approximately $4.184 \mathrm{~J} / \mathrm{g}{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, so we use that for the specific heat of the solution. Substituting these values gives:

$$
q_{\text {solution }}=\left(4.184 \mathrm{~J} / \mathrm{g}^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)\left(1.0 \times 10^{2} \mathrm{~g}\right)\left(28.9^{\circ} \mathrm{C}-22.0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)=2.9 \times 10^{3} \mathrm{~J}
$$

Finally, since we are trying to find the heat of the reaction, we have:

$$
q_{\text {reaction }}=-q_{\text {solution }}=-2.9 \times 10^{3} \mathrm{~J}
$$

The negative sign indicates that the reaction is exothermic. It produces 2.9 kJ of heat.

How much heat is produced by this precipitation reaction? What assumptions did you make to determine your value?

Answer: $1.34 \times 10^{3} \mathrm{~J}$; assume no heat is absorbed by the calorimeter, no heat is exchanged between the calorimeter and its surroundings, and that the specific heat and mass of the solution are the same as those for water

#### Chemistry in Everyday Life

**Thermochemistry of Hand Warmers**

When working or playing outdoors on a cold day, you might use a hand warmer to warm your hands (Figure 5.15). A common reusable hand warmer contains a supersaturated solution of $\mathrm{NaC}_{2} \mathrm{H}_{3} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ (sodium acetate) and a metal disc. Bending the disk creates nucleation sites around which the metastable $\mathrm{NaC}_{2} \mathrm{H}_{3} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ quickly crystallizes (a later chapter on solutions will investigate saturation and supersaturation in more detail).
The process $\mathrm{NaC}_{2} \mathrm{H}_{3} \mathrm{O}_{2}(a q) \longrightarrow \mathrm{NaC}_{2} \mathrm{H}_{3} \mathrm{O}_{2}(s)$ is exothermic, and the heat produced by this process is absorbed by your hands, thereby warming them (at least for a while). If the hand warmer is reheated, the $\mathrm{NaC}_{2} \mathrm{H}_{3} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ redissolves and can be reused.

Another common hand warmer produces heat when it is ripped open, exposing iron and water in the hand warmer to oxygen in the air. One simplified version of this exothermic reaction is $2 \mathrm{Fe}(s)+\frac{3}{2} \mathrm{O}_{2}(g) \longrightarrow \mathrm{Fe}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3}(s)$. Salt in the hand warmer catalyzes the reaction, so it produces heat more rapidly; cellulose, vermiculite, and activated carbon help distribute the heat evenly. Other types of hand warmers use lighter fluid (a platinum catalyst helps lighter fluid oxidize exothermically), charcoal (charcoal oxidizes in a special case), or electrical units that produce heat by passing an electrical current from a battery through resistive wires.

**Heat Flow in an Instant Ice Pack**

When solid ammonium nitrate dissolves in water, the solution becomes cold. This is the basis for an "instant ice pack" (Figure 5.16). When 3.21 g of solid $\mathrm{NH}_{4} \mathrm{NO}_{3}$ dissolves in 50.0 g of water at $24.9^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ in a calorimeter, the temperature decreases to $20.3^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$.

Calculate the value of $q$ for this reaction and explain the meaning of its arithmetic sign. State any assumptions that you made.
![Image](Chapter_5_images/img-15.jpeg)

Figure 5.16 An instant cold pack consists of a bag containing solid ammonium nitrate and a second bag of water. When the bag of water is broken, the pack becomes cold because the dissolution of ammonium nitrate is an endothermic process that removes thermal energy from the water. The cold pack then removes thermal energy from your body.

**Solution**

We assume that the calorimeter prevents heat transfer between the solution and its external environment (including the calorimeter itself), in which case:

$$
q_{\mathrm{rxn}}=-q_{\text {soln }}
$$

with "rxn" and "soln" used as shorthand for "reaction" and "solution," respectively.
Assuming also that the specific heat of the solution is the same as that for water, we have:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& q_{\mathrm{rxn}}=-q_{\text {soln }}=-(c \times m \times \Delta T)_{\text {soln }} \\
& =-\left[\left(4.184 \mathrm{~J} / \mathrm{g}^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right) \times(53.2 \mathrm{~g}) \times\left(20.3^{\circ} \mathrm{C}-24.9^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)\right] \\
& =-\left[\left(4.184 \mathrm{~J} / \mathrm{g}^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right) \times(53.2 \mathrm{~g}) \times\left(-4.6^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)\right] \\
& +1.0 \times 10^{3} \mathrm{~J}=+1.0 \mathrm{~kJ}
\end{aligned}
$$

The positive sign for $q$ indicates that the dissolution is an endothermic process.

Answer: 1.33 kJ ; assume that the calorimeter prevents heat transfer between the solution and its external environment (including the calorimeter itself) and that the specific heat of the solution is the same as that for water

If the amount of heat absorbed by a calorimeter is too large to neglect or if we require more accurate results, then we must take into account the heat absorbed both by the solution and by the calorimeter.

The calorimeters described are designed to operate at constant (atmospheric) pressure and are convenient to measure heat flow accompanying processes that occur in solution. A different type of calorimeter that operates at constant volume, colloquially known as a bomb calorimeter, is used to measure the energy produced by reactions that yield large amounts of heat and gaseous products, such as combustion reactions. (The term "bomb" comes from the observation that these reactions can be vigorous enough to resemble explosions that would damage other calorimeters.) This type of calorimeter consists of a robust steel container (the "bomb") that contains the reactants and is itself submerged in water (Figure 5.17). The sample is placed in the bomb, which is then filled with oxygen at high pressure. A small electrical spark is used to ignite the sample. The energy produced by the reaction is absorbed by the steel bomb and the surrounding water. The temperature increase is measured and, along with the known heat capacity of the calorimeter, is used to calculate the energy produced by the reaction. Bomb calorimeters require calibration to determine the heat capacity of the calorimeter and ensure accurate results. The calibration is accomplished using a reaction with a known $q$, such as a measured quantity of benzoic acid ignited by a spark from a nickel fuse wire that is weighed before and after the reaction. The temperature change produced by the known reaction is used to determine the heat capacity of the calorimeter. The calibration is generally performed each time before the calorimeter is used to gather research data.

#### Example 5.7

**Bomb Calorimetry**

When 3.12 g of glucose, $\mathrm{C}_{6} \mathrm{H}_{12} \mathrm{O}_{6}$, is burned in a bomb calorimeter, the temperature of the calorimeter increases from $23.8^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ to $35.6^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. The calorimeter contains 775 g of water, and the bomb itself has a heat capacity of $893 \mathrm{~J} /{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. How much heat was produced by the combustion of the glucose sample?

**Solution**

The combustion produces heat that is primarily absorbed by the water and the bomb. (The amounts of heat absorbed by the reaction products and the unreacted excess oxygen are relatively small and dealing with them is beyond the scope of this text. We will neglect them in our calculations.)

The heat produced by the reaction is absorbed by the water and the bomb:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& q_{\text {rxn }}=-\left(q_{\text {water }}+q_{\text {bomb }}\right) \\
& =-\left[\left(4.184 \mathrm{~J} / \mathrm{g}^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right) \times(775 \mathrm{~g}) \times\left(35.6^{\circ} \mathrm{C}-23.8^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)+893 \mathrm{~J} /{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C} \times\left(35.6^{\circ} \mathrm{C}-23.8^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)\right] \\
& =-(38,300 \mathrm{~J}+10,500 \mathrm{~J}) \\
& =-48,800 \mathrm{~J}=-48.8 \mathrm{~kJ}

Since the first one was constructed in 1899, 35 calorimeters have been built to measure the heat produced by a living person. ${ }^{[2]}$ These whole-body calorimeters of various designs are large enough to hold an individual human being. More recently, whole-room calorimeters allow for relatively normal activities to be performed, and these calorimeters generate data that more closely reflect the real world. These calorimeters are used to measure the metabolism of individuals under different environmental conditions, different dietary regimes, and with different health conditions, such as diabetes. In humans, metabolism is typically measured in Calories per day. A nutritional calorie (Calorie) is the energy unit used to quantify the amount of energy derived from the metabolism of foods; one Calorie is equal to 1000 calories ( 1 kcal ), the amount of energy needed to heat 1 kg of water by $1^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$.

#### Chemistry in Everyday Life

**Measuring Nutritional Calories**

In your day-to-day life, you may be more familiar with energy being given in Calories, or nutritional calories, which are used to quantify the amount of energy in foods. One calorie (cal) = exactly 4.184 joules, and one Calorie (note the capitalization) $=1000 \mathrm{cal}$, or 1 kcal . (This is approximately the amount of energy needed to heat 1 kg of water by $1^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$.)
The macronutrients in food are proteins, carbohydrates, and fats or oils. Proteins provide about 4 Calories per gram, carbohydrates also provide about 4 Calories per gram, and fats and oils provide about 9 Calories/ g. Nutritional labels on food packages show the caloric content of one serving of the food, as well as the breakdown into Calories from each of the three macronutrients (Figure 5.18).

Figure 5.18 (a) Macaroni and cheese contain energy in the form of the macronutrients in the food. (b) The food's nutritional information is shown on the package label. In the US, the energy content is given in Calories (per serving); the rest of the world usually uses kilojoules. (credit a: modification of work by "Rex Roof'/Flickr)

For the example shown in (b), the total energy per 228-g portion is calculated by:

$$
(5 \mathrm{~g} \text { protein } \times 4 \text { Calories } / \mathrm{g})+(31 \mathrm{~g} \text { carb } \times 4 \text { Calories } / \mathrm{g})+(12 \mathrm{~g} \text { fat } \times 9 \text { Calories } / \mathrm{g})=252 \text { Calories }
$$

So, you can use food labels to count your Calories. But where do the values come from? And how accurate are they? The caloric content of foods can be determined by using bomb calorimetry; that is, by burning the food and measuring the energy it contains. A sample of food is weighed, mixed in a blender, freeze-dried, ground into powder, and formed into a pellet. The pellet is burned inside a bomb calorimeter, and the measured temperature change is converted into energy per gram of food.

Today, the caloric content on food labels is derived using a method called the Atwater system that uses the average caloric content of the different chemical constituents of food, protein, carbohydrate, and fats. The average amounts are those given in the equation and are derived from the various results given by bomb calorimetry of whole foods. The carbohydrate amount is discounted a certain amount for the fiber content, which is indigestible carbohydrate. To determine the energy content of a food, the quantities of carbohydrate, protein, and fat are each multiplied by the average Calories per gram for each and the products summed to obtain the total energy.

### 5.3 Enthalpy 

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

- Define enthalpy and explain its classification as a state function
- Write and balance thermochemical equations
- Calculate enthalpy changes for various chemical reactions
- Explain Hess's law and use it to compute reaction enthalpies

Thermochemistry is a branch of chemical thermodynamics, the science that deals with the relationships between heat, work, and other forms of energy in the context of chemical and physical processes. As we concentrate on thermochemistry in this chapter, we need to consider some widely used concepts of thermodynamics.

Substances act as reservoirs of energy, meaning that energy can be added to them or removed from them. Energy is stored in a substance when the kinetic energy of its atoms or molecules is raised. The greater kinetic energy may be in the form of increased translations (travel or straight-line motions), vibrations, or rotations of the atoms or molecules. When thermal energy is lost, the intensities of these motions decrease and the kinetic energy falls. The total of all possible kinds of energy present in a substance is called the internal energy $(\boldsymbol{U})$, sometimes symbolized as $E$.

As a system undergoes a change, its internal energy can change, and energy can be transferred from the system to the surroundings, or from the surroundings to the system. Energy is transferred into a system when it absorbs heat (q) from the surroundings or when the surroundings do work ( $w$ ) on the system. For example, energy is transferred into room-temperature metal wire if it is immersed in hot water (the wire absorbs heat from the water), or if you rapidly bend the wire back and forth (the wire becomes warmer because of the work done on it). Both processes increase the internal energy of the wire, which is reflected in an increase in the wire's temperature. Conversely, energy is transferred out of a system when heat is lost from the system, or when the system does work on the surroundings.

The relationship between internal energy, heat, and work can be represented by the equation:

$$
\Delta U=q+w
$$

as shown in Figure 5.19. This is one version of the first law of thermodynamics, and it shows that the internal energy of a system changes through heat flow into or out of the system (positive $q$ is heat flow in; negative $q$ is heat flow out) or work done on or by the system. The work, $w$, is positive if it is done on the system and negative if it is done by the system.
![Image](Chapter_5_images/img-18.jpeg)

Figure 5.19 The internal energy, $U$, of a system can be changed by heat flow and work. If heat flows into the system, $q_{\text {in }}$, or work is done on the system, $w_{\text {on }}$, its internal energy increases, $\Delta U>0$. If heat flows out of the system, $q_{\text {out }}$, or work is done by the system, $w_{\text {by }}$, its internal energy decreases, $\Delta U<0$.

A type of work called expansion work (or pressure-volume work) occurs when a system pushes back the surroundings against a restraining pressure, or when the surroundings compress the system. An example of this occurs during the operation of an internal combustion engine. The reaction of gasoline and oxygen is exothermic. Some of this energy is given off as heat, and some does work pushing the piston in the cylinder. The substances involved in the reaction are the system, and the engine and the rest of the universe are the surroundings. The system loses energy by both heating and doing work on the surroundings, and its internal energy decreases. (The engine is able to keep the car moving because this process is repeated many times per second while the engine is running.) We will consider how to determine the amount of work involved in a chemical or physical change in the chapter on thermodynamics.

**Link to Learning** 

This view of an internal combustion engine (http://openstaxcollege.org/1/16combustion) illustrates the conversion of energy produced by the exothermic combustion reaction of a fuel such as gasoline into energy of motion.

As discussed, the relationship between internal energy, heat, and work can be represented as $\Delta U=q+w$. Internal energy is an example of a state function (or state variable), whereas heat and work are not state functions. The value of a state function depends only on the state that a system is in, and not on how that state is reached. If a quantity is not a state function, then its value does depend on how the state is reached. An example of a state function is altitude or elevation. If you stand on the summit of Mt. Kilimanjaro, you are at an altitude of 5895 m , and it does not matter whether you hiked there or parachuted there. The distance you traveled to the top of Kilimanjaro, however, is not a state function. You could climb to the summit by a direct route or by a more roundabout, circuitous path (Figure 5.20). The distances traveled would differ (distance is not a state function) but the elevation reached would be the same (altitude is a state function).
![Image](Chapter_5_images/img-19.jpeg)

Figure 5.20 Paths $X$ and $Y$ represent two different routes to the summit of Mt. Kilimanjaro. Both have the same change in elevation (altitude or elevation on a mountain is a state function; it does not depend on path), but they have very different distances traveled (distance walked is not a state function; it depends on the path).

Chemists ordinarily use a property known as enthalpy $(\boldsymbol{H})$ to describe the thermodynamics of chemical and physical processes. Enthalpy is defined as the sum of a system's internal energy $(U)$ and the mathematical product of its

pressure $(P)$ and volume $(V)$ :

$$
H=U+P V
$$

Enthalpy is also a state function. Enthalpy values for specific substances cannot be measured directly; only enthalpy changes for chemical or physical processes can be determined. For processes that take place at constant pressure (a common condition for many chemical and physical changes), the enthalpy change $(\Delta \boldsymbol{H})$ is:

$$
\Delta H=\Delta U+P \Delta V
$$

The mathematical product $P \Delta V$ represents work $(w)$, namely, expansion or pressure-volume work as noted. By their definitions, the arithmetic signs of $\Delta V$ and $w$ will always be opposite:

$$
P \Delta V=-w
$$

Substituting this equation and the definition of internal energy into the enthalpy-change equation yields:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \Delta H=\Delta U+P \Delta V \\
& =q_{\mathrm{p}}+w-w \\
& =q_{\mathrm{p}}
\end{aligned}
$$

where $q_{p}$ is the heat of reaction under conditions of constant pressure.
And so, if a chemical or physical process is carried out at constant pressure with the only work done caused by expansion or contraction, then the heat flow $\left(q_{p}\right)$ and enthalpy change $(\Delta H)$ for the process are equal.

The heat given off when you operate a Bunsen burner is equal to the enthalpy change of the methane combustion reaction that takes place, since it occurs at the essentially constant pressure of the atmosphere. On the other hand, the heat produced by a reaction measured in a bomb calorimeter (Figure 5.17) is not equal to $\Delta H$ because the closed, constant-volume metal container prevents the pressure from remaining constant (it may increase or decrease if the reaction yields increased or decreased amounts of gaseous species). Chemists usually perform experiments under normal atmospheric conditions, at constant external pressure with $q=\Delta H$, which makes enthalpy the most convenient choice for determining heat changes for chemical reactions.

The following conventions apply when using $\Delta H$ :

- A negative value of an enthalpy change, $\Delta H<0$, indicates an exothermic reaction; a positive value, $\Delta H>0$, indicates an endothermic reaction. If the direction of a chemical equation is reversed, the arithmetic sign of its $\Delta H$ is changed (a process that is endothermic in one direction is exothermic in the opposite direction).
- Chemists use a thermochemical equation to represent the changes in both matter and energy. In a thermochemical equation, the enthalpy change of a reaction is shown as a $\Delta H$ value following the equation for the reaction. This $\Delta H$ value indicates the amount of heat associated with the reaction involving the number of moles of reactants and products as shown in the chemical equation. For example, consider this equation:

$$
\mathrm{H}_{2}(g)+\frac{1}{2} \mathrm{O}_{2}(g) \longrightarrow \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}(l) \quad \Delta H=-286 \mathrm{~kJ}
$$

This equation indicates that when 1 mole of hydrogen gas and $\frac{1}{2}$ mole of oxygen gas at some temperature and pressure change to 1 mole of liquid water at the same temperature and pressure, 286 kJ of heat are released to the surroundings. If the coefficients of the chemical equation are multiplied by some factor, the enthalpy change must be multiplied by that same factor ( $\Delta H$ is an extensive property):
(two-fold increase in amounts)

$$
\begin{aligned}
& 2 \mathrm{H}_{2}(g)+\mathrm{O}_{2}(g) \longrightarrow 2 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}(l) \quad \Delta H=2 \times(-286 \mathrm{~kJ})=-572 \mathrm{~kJ} \\
& \text { (two-fold decrease in amounts) } \\
& \frac{1}{2} \mathrm{H}_{2}(g)+\frac{1}{4} \mathrm{O}_{2}(g) \longrightarrow \frac{1}{2} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}(l) \quad \Delta H=\frac{1}{2} \times(-286 \mathrm{~kJ})=-143 \mathrm{~kJ}
\end{aligned}
$$

- The enthalpy change of a reaction depends on the physical states of the reactants and products, so these must be shown. For example, when 1 mole of hydrogen gas and $\frac{1}{2}$ mole of oxygen gas change to 1 mole of liquid

water at the same temperature and pressure, 286 kJ of heat are released. If gaseous water forms, only 242 kJ of heat are released.

$$
\mathrm{H}_{2}(g)+\frac{1}{2} \mathrm{O}_{2}(g) \longrightarrow \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}(g) \quad \Delta H=-242 \mathrm{~kJ}
$$

**Writing Thermochemical Equations**

When 0.0500 mol of $\mathrm{HCl}(a q)$ reacts with 0.0500 mol of $\mathrm{NaOH}(a q)$ to form 0.0500 mol of $\mathrm{NaCl}(a q), 2.9 \mathrm{~kJ}$ of heat are produced. Write a balanced thermochemical equation for the reaction of one mole of HCl .?

$$
\mathrm{HCl}(a q)+\mathrm{NaOH}(a q) \longrightarrow \mathrm{NaCl}(a q)+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}(l)
$$

**Solution**

For the reaction of 0.0500 mol acid $(\mathrm{HCl}), q=-2.9 \mathrm{~kJ}$. The reactants are provided in stoichiometric amounts (same molar ratio as in the balanced equation), and so the amount of acid may be used to calculate a molar enthalpy change. Since $\Delta H$ is an extensive property, it is proportional to the amount of acid neutralized:

$$
\Delta H=1 \mathrm{molHCl} \times \frac{-2.9 \mathrm{~kJ}}{0.0500 \mathrm{molHCl}}=-58 \mathrm{~kJ}
$$

The thermochemical equation is then

$$
\mathrm{HCl}(a q)+\mathrm{NaOH}(a q) \longrightarrow \mathrm{NaCl}(a q)+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}(l) \quad \Delta H=-58 \mathrm{~kJ}
$$

Answer: $\Delta H=-153 \mathrm{~kJ}$
Be sure to take both stoichiometry and limiting reactants into account when determining the $\Delta H$ for a chemical reaction.

#### Example 5.9

**Writing Thermochemical Equations**

A gummy bear contains 2.67 g sucrose, $\mathrm{C}_{12} \mathrm{H}_{22} \mathrm{O}_{11}$. When it reacts with 7.19 g potassium chlorate, $\mathrm{KClO}_{3}$, 43.7 kJ of heat are produced. Write a thermochemical equation for the reaction of one mole of sucrose:

$$
\mathrm{C}_{12} \mathrm{H}_{22} \mathrm{O}_{11}(a q)+8 \mathrm{KClO}_{3}(a q) \longrightarrow 12 \mathrm{CO}_{2}(g)+11 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}(l)+8 \mathrm{KCl}(a q)
$$

**Solution**

Unlike the previous example exercise, this one does not involve the reaction of stoichiometric amounts of reactants, and so the limiting reactant must be identified (it limits the yield of the reaction and the amount of thermal energy produced or consumed).
The provided amounts of the two reactants are

$$
\begin{aligned}
& (2.67 \mathrm{~g})(1 \mathrm{~mol} / 342.3 \mathrm{~g})=0.00780 \mathrm{~mol} \mathrm{C}_{12} \mathrm{H}_{22} \mathrm{O}_{11} \\
& (7.19 \mathrm{~g})(1 \mathrm{~mol} / 122.5 \mathrm{~g})=0.0587 \mathrm{~mol} \mathrm{KCIO}_{3}
\end{aligned}
$$

The provided molar ratio of perchlorate-to-sucrose is then

$$
0.0587 \mathrm{~mol} \mathrm{KCIO}_{3} / 0.00780 \mathrm{~mol} \mathrm{C}_{12} \mathrm{H}_{22} \mathrm{O}_{11}=7.52
$$

The balanced equation indicates $8 \mathrm{~mol} \mathrm{KClO}_{3}$ are required for reaction with $1 \mathrm{~mol} \mathrm{C}_{12} \mathrm{H}_{22} \mathrm{O}_{11}$. Since the provided amount of $\mathrm{KClO}_{3}$ is less than the stoichiometric amount, it is the limiting reactant and may be used to compute the enthalpy change:

$$
\triangle \mathrm{H}=-43.7 \mathrm{~kJ} / 0.0587 \mathrm{~mol} \mathrm{KCIO}_{3}=744 \mathrm{~kJ} / \mathrm{mol} \mathrm{KCIO}_{3}
$$

Because the equation, as written, represents the reaction of $8 \mathrm{~mol} \mathrm{KClO}_{3}$, the enthalpy change is

$$
\left(744 \mathrm{~kJ} / \mathrm{mol} \mathrm{KClO}_{3}\right)\left(8 \mathrm{~mol} \mathrm{KClO}_{3}\right)=5960 \mathrm{~kJ}
$$

The enthalpy change for this reaction is -5960 kJ , and the thermochemical equation is:

$$
\mathrm{C}_{12} \mathrm{H}_{22} \mathrm{O}_{11}+8 \mathrm{KClO}_{3} \longrightarrow 12 \mathrm{CO}_{2}+11 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}+8 \mathrm{KCl} \quad \Delta H=-5960 \mathrm{~kJ}
$$

When 1.42 g of iron reacts with 1.80 g of chlorine, 3.22 g of $\mathrm{FeCl}_{2}(\mathrm{~s})$ and 8.60 kJ of heat is produced. What is the enthalpy change for the reaction when 1 mole of $\mathrm{FeCl}_{2}(\mathrm{~s})$ is produced?

Answer: $\Delta H=-338 \mathrm{~kJ}$
Enthalpy changes are typically tabulated for reactions in which both the reactants and products are at the same conditions. A standard state is a commonly accepted set of conditions used as a reference point for the determination of properties under other different conditions. For chemists, the IUPAC standard state refers to materials under a pressure of 1 bar and solutions at 1 M , and does not specify a temperature. Many thermochemical tables list values with a standard state of 1 atm . Because the $\Delta H$ of a reaction changes very little with such small changes in pressure ( $1 \mathrm{bar}=0.987 \mathrm{~atm}$ ), $\Delta H$ values (except for the most precisely measured values) are essentially the same under both sets of standard conditions. We will include a superscripted "o" in the enthalpy change symbol to designate standard state. Since the usual (but not technically standard) temperature is 298.15 K , this temperature will be assumed unless some other temperature is specified. Thus, the symbol $\left(\Delta H^{\circ}\right)$ is used to indicate an enthalpy change for a process occurring under these conditions. (The symbol $\Delta H$ is used to indicate an enthalpy change for a reaction occurring under nonstandard conditions.)

The enthalpy changes for many types of chemical and physical processes are available in the reference literature, including those for combustion reactions, phase transitions, and formation reactions. As we discuss these quantities, it is important to pay attention to the extensive nature of enthalpy and enthalpy changes. Since the enthalpy change for a given reaction is proportional to the amounts of substances involved, it may be reported on that basis (i.e., as the $\Delta H$ for specific amounts of reactants). However, we often find it more useful to divide one extensive property $(\Delta H)$ by another (amount of substance), and report a per-amount intensive value of $\Delta H$, often "normalized" to a per-mole basis. (Note that this is similar to determining the intensive property specific heat from the extensive property heat capacity, as seen previously.)

#### Standard Enthalpy of Combustion

Standard enthalpy of combustion $\left(\Delta H_{C}^{*}\right)$ is the enthalpy change when 1 mole of a substance burns (combines vigorously with oxygen) under standard state conditions; it is sometimes called "heat of combustion." For example, the enthalpy of combustion of ethanol, $-1366.8 \mathrm{~kJ} / \mathrm{mol}$, is the amount of heat produced when one mole of ethanol undergoes complete combustion at $25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ and 1 atmosphere pressure, yielding products also at $25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ and 1 atm .

$$
\mathrm{C}_{2} \mathrm{H}_{5} \mathrm{OH}(l)+3 \mathrm{O}_{2}(g) \longrightarrow 2 \mathrm{CO}_{2}+3 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}(l) \quad \Delta H^{\circ}=-1366.8 \mathrm{~kJ}
$$

Enthalpies of combustion for many substances have been measured; a few of these are listed in Table 5.2. Many readily available substances with large enthalpies of combustion are used as fuels, including hydrogen, carbon (as coal or charcoal), and hydrocarbons (compounds containing only hydrogen and carbon), such as methane, propane, and the major components of gasoline.

Table 5.2 Standard Molar Enthalpies of Combustion

#### Example 5.10 

**Using Enthalpy of Combustion**

As Figure 5.21 suggests, the combustion of gasoline is a highly exothermic process. Let us determine the approximate amount of heat produced by burning 1.00 L of gasoline, assuming the enthalpy of combustion of gasoline is the same as that of isooctane, a common component of gasoline. The density of isooctane is $0.692 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{mL}$.
![Image](Chapter_5_images/img-20.jpeg)

Figure 5.21 The combustion of gasoline is very exothermic. (credit: modification of work by "AlexEagle"/Flickr)

**Solution** 

Starting with a known amount ( 1.00 L of isooctane), we can perform conversions between units until we arrive at the desired amount of heat or energy. The enthalpy of combustion of isooctane provides one of the necessary conversions. Table 5.2 gives this value as -5460 kJ per 1 mole of isooctane $\left(\mathrm{C}_{8} \mathrm{H}_{18}\right)$.
Using these data,

$$
1.00 \mathrm{LC}_{8} \mathrm{H}_{18} \times \frac{1000 \mathrm{mLC}_{8} \mathrm{H}_{18}}{1 \mathrm{LC}_{8} \mathrm{H}_{18}} \times \frac{0.692 \mathrm{~g} \mathrm{C}_{8} \mathrm{H}_{18}}{1 \mathrm{mLC}_{8} \mathrm{H}_{18}} \times \frac{1 \mathrm{mol}_{\mathrm{C}_{8}} \mathrm{H}_{18}}{114 \mathrm{gC}_{8} \mathrm{H}_{18}} \times \frac{-5460 \mathrm{~kJ}}{1 \mathrm{molC}_{8} \mathrm{H}_{18}}=-3.31 \times 10^{4} \mathrm{~kJ}
$$

The combustion of 1.00 L of isooctane produces $33,100 \mathrm{~kJ}$ of heat. (This amount of energy is enough to melt 99.2 kg , or about 218 lbs , of ice.)

Note: If you do this calculation one step at a time, you would find:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& 1.00 \mathrm{LC}_{8} \mathrm{H}_{18} \longrightarrow 1.00 \times 10^{3} \mathrm{~mL} \mathrm{C}_{8} \mathrm{H}_{18} \\
& 1.00 \times 10^{3} \mathrm{~mL} \mathrm{C}_{8} \mathrm{H}_{18} \longrightarrow 692 \mathrm{~g} \mathrm{C}_{8} \mathrm{H}_{18} \\
& 692 \mathrm{~g} \mathrm{C}_{8} \mathrm{H}_{18} \longrightarrow 6.07 \mathrm{~mol} \mathrm{C}_{8} \mathrm{H}_{18} \\
& 692 \mathrm{~g} \mathrm{C}_{8} \mathrm{H}_{18} \longrightarrow-3.31 \times 10^{4} \mathrm{~kJ}

**Emerging Algae-Based Energy Technologies (Biofuels)**

As reserves of fossil fuels diminish and become more costly to extract, the search is ongoing for replacement fuel sources for the future. Among the most promising biofuels are those derived from algae (Figure 5.22). The species of algae used are nontoxic, biodegradable, and among the world's fastest growing organisms. About $50 \%$ of algal weight is oil, which can be readily converted into fuel such as biodiesel. Algae can yield 26,000 gallons of biofuel per hectare-much more energy per acre than other crops. Some strains of algae can flourish in brackish water that is not usable for growing other crops. Algae can produce biodiesel, biogasoline, ethanol, butanol, methane, and even jet fuel.

According to the US Department of Energy, only 39,000 square kilometers (about $0.4 \%$ of the land mass of the US or less than $\frac{1}{2}$ of the area used to grow corn) can produce enough algal fuel to replace all the petroleumbased fuel used in the US. The cost of algal fuels is becoming more competitive-for instance, the US Air Force is producing jet fuel from algae at a total cost of under $\$ 5$ per gallon. ${ }^{[3]}$ The process used to produce algal fuel is as follows: grow the algae (which use sunlight as their energy source and $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ as a raw material); harvest the algae; extract the fuel compounds (or precursor compounds); process as necessary (e.g., perform a transesterification reaction to make biodiesel); purify; and distribute (Figure 5.23).

#### Standard Enthalpy of Formation 

A standard enthalpy of formation is an enthalpy change for a reaction in which exactly 1 mole of a pure substance is formed from free elements in their most stable states under standard state conditions. These values are especially useful for computing or predicting enthalpy changes for chemical reactions that are impractical or dangerous to carry out, or for processes for which it is difficult to make measurements. If we have values for the appropriate standard enthalpies of formation, we can determine the enthalpy change for any reaction, which we will practice in the next section on Hess's law.

The standard enthalpy of formation of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}(g)$ is $-393.5 \mathrm{~kJ} / \mathrm{mol}$. This is the enthalpy change for the exothermic reaction:

$$
\mathrm{C}(s)+\mathrm{O}_{2}(g) \longrightarrow \mathrm{CO}_{2}(g) \quad \Delta H_{\mathrm{f}}^{\circ}=\Delta H^{\circ}=-393.5 \mathrm{~kJ}
$$

starting with the reactants at a pressure of 1 atm and $25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ (with the carbon present as graphite, the most stable form of carbon under these conditions) and ending with one mole of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$, also at 1 atm and $25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. For nitrogen dioxide, $\mathrm{NO}_{2}(g), \Delta H_{\mathrm{f}}^{\circ} \quad$ is $33.2 \mathrm{~kJ} / \mathrm{mol}$. This is the enthalpy change for the reaction:

$$
\frac{1}{2} \mathrm{~N}_{2}(g)+\mathrm{O}_{2}(g) \longrightarrow \mathrm{NO}_{2}(g) \quad \Delta H_{\mathrm{f}}^{\circ}=\Delta H^{\circ}=+33.2 \mathrm{~kJ}
$$

A reaction equation with $\frac{1}{2}$ mole of $\mathrm{N}_{2}$ and 1 mole of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ is correct in this case because the standard enthalpy of formation always refers to 1 mole of product, $\mathrm{NO}_{2}(g)$.
You will find a table of standard enthalpies of formation of many common substances in Appendix G. These values indicate that formation reactions range from highly exothermic (such as $-2984 \mathrm{~kJ} / \mathrm{mol}$ for the formation of $\mathrm{P}_{4} \mathrm{O}_{10}$ ) to strongly endothermic (such as $+226.7 \mathrm{~kJ} / \mathrm{mol}$ for the formation of acetylene, $\mathrm{C}_{2} \mathrm{H}_{2}$ ). By definition, the standard enthalpy of formation of an element in its most stable form is equal to zero under standard conditions, which is 1 atm for gases and 1 M for solutions.

#### Example 5.11

**Evaluating an Enthalpy of Formation**

Ozone, $\mathrm{O}_{3}(g)$, forms from oxygen, $\mathrm{O}_{2}(g)$, by an endothermic process. Ultraviolet radiation is the source of the energy that drives this reaction in the upper atmosphere. Assuming that both the reactants and products of the reaction are in their standard states, determine the standard enthalpy of formation, $\Delta H_{\mathrm{f}}^{\circ}$ of ozone from the following information:

$$
3 \mathrm{O}_{2}(g) \longrightarrow 2 \mathrm{O}_{3}(g) \quad \Delta H^{\circ}=+286 \mathrm{~kJ}
$$

**Solution**

$\Delta H_{\mathrm{f}}^{\circ}$ is the enthalpy change for the formation of one mole of a substance in its standard state from the elements in their standard states. Thus, $\Delta H_{\mathrm{f}}^{\circ}$ for $\mathrm{O}_{3}(g)$ is the enthalpy change for the reaction:

$$
\frac{3}{2} \mathrm{O}_{2}(g) \longrightarrow \mathrm{O}_{3}(g)
$$

For the formation of 2 mol of $\mathrm{O}_{3}(g), \Delta H^{\circ}=+286 \mathrm{~kJ}$. This ratio, $\left(\frac{286 \mathrm{~kJ}}{2 \mathrm{molO}_{3}}\right)$, can be used as a conversion factor to find the heat produced when 1 mole of $\mathrm{O}_{3}(g)$ is formed, which is the enthalpy of formation for $\mathrm{O}_{3}(g):$

$$
\Delta H^{\circ} \text { for } 1 \text { mole of } \mathrm{O}_{3}(g)=1 \mathrm{molO}_{3} \times \frac{286 \mathrm{~kJ}}{2 \mathrm{molO}_{3}}=143 \mathrm{~kJ}
$$

Therefore, $\Delta H_{\mathrm{f}}^{\circ}\left[\mathrm{O}_{3}(g)\right]=+143 \mathrm{~kJ} / \mathrm{mol}$.

#### Hess's Law

There are two ways to determine the amount of heat involved in a chemical change: measure it experimentally, or calculate it from other experimentally determined enthalpy changes. Some reactions are difficult, if not impossible, to investigate and make accurate measurements for experimentally. And even when a reaction is not hard to perform or measure, it is convenient to be able to determine the heat involved in a reaction without having to perform an experiment.

This type of calculation usually involves the use of Hess's law, which states: If a process can be written as the sum of several stepwise processes, the enthalpy change of the total process equals the sum of the enthalpy changes of the various steps. Hess's law is valid because enthalpy is a state function: Enthalpy changes depend only on where a chemical process starts and ends, but not on the path it takes from start to finish. For example, we can think of the reaction of carbon with oxygen to form carbon dioxide as occurring either directly or by a two-step process. The direct process is written:

$$
\mathrm{C}(s)+\mathrm{O}_{2}(g) \longrightarrow \mathrm{CO}_{2}(g) \quad \Delta H^{\circ}=-394 \mathrm{~kJ}
$$

In the two-step process, first carbon monoxide is formed:

$$
\mathrm{C}(s)+\frac{1}{2} \mathrm{O}_{2}(g) \longrightarrow \mathrm{CO}(g) \quad \Delta H^{\circ}=-111 \mathrm{~kJ}
$$

Then, carbon monoxide reacts further to form carbon dioxide:

$$
\mathrm{CO}(g)+\frac{1}{2} \mathrm{O}_{2}(g) \longrightarrow \mathrm{CO}_{2}(g) \quad \Delta H^{\circ}=-283 \mathrm{~kJ}
$$

The equation describing the overall reaction is the sum of these two chemical changes:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \text { Step 1: } \mathrm{C}(s)+\frac{1}{2} \mathrm{O}_{2}(g) \longrightarrow \mathrm{CO}(g) \\
& \text { Step 2: } \mathrm{CO}(g)+\frac{1}{2} \mathrm{O}_{2}(g) \longrightarrow \mathrm{CO}_{2}(g) \\
& \text { Sum: } \mathrm{C}(s)+\frac{1}{2} \mathrm{O}_{2}(g)+\mathrm{CO}(g)+\frac{1}{2} \mathrm{O}_{2}(g) \longrightarrow \mathrm{CO}(g)+\mathrm{CO}_{2}(g)
\end{aligned}
$$

Because the CO produced in Step 1 is consumed in Step 2, the net change is:

$$
\mathrm{C}(s)+\mathrm{O}_{2}(g) \longrightarrow \mathrm{CO}_{2}(g)
$$

According to Hess's law, the enthalpy change of the reaction will equal the sum of the enthalpy changes of the steps.

$$

The result is shown in Figure 5.24. We see that $\Delta H$ of the overall reaction is the same whether it occurs in one step or two. This finding (overall $\Delta H$ for the reaction $=$ sum of $\Delta H$ values for reaction "steps" in the overall reaction) is true in general for chemical and physical processes.
![Image](Chapter_5_images/img-23.jpeg)

Figure 5.24 The formation of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}(g)$ from its elements can be thought of as occurring in two steps, which sum to the overall reaction, as described by Hess's law. The horizontal blue lines represent enthalpies. For an exothermic process, the products are at lower enthalpy than are the reactants.

Before we further practice using Hess's law, let us recall two important features of $\Delta H$.

1. $\Delta H$ is directly proportional to the quantities of reactants or products. For example, the enthalpy change for the reaction forming 1 mole of $\mathrm{NO}_{2}(g)$ is +33.2 kJ :

$$
\frac{1}{2} \mathrm{~N}_{2}(g)+\mathrm{O}_{2}(g) \longrightarrow \mathrm{NO}_{2}(g) \quad \Delta H=+33.2 \mathrm{~kJ}
$$

When 2 moles of $\mathrm{NO}_{2}$ (twice as much) are formed, the $\Delta H$ will be twice as large:

$$
\mathrm{N}_{2}(g)+2 \mathrm{O}_{2}(g) \longrightarrow 2 \mathrm{NO}_{2}(g) \quad \Delta H=+66.4 \mathrm{~kJ}
$$

In general, if we multiply or divide an equation by a number, then the enthalpy change should also be multiplied or divided by the same number.
2. $\Delta H$ for a reaction in one direction is equal in magnitude and opposite in sign to $\Delta H$ for the reaction in the reverse direction. For example, given that:

$$
\mathrm{H}_{2}(g)+\mathrm{Cl}_{2}(g) \longrightarrow 2 \mathrm{HCl}(g) \quad \Delta H=-184.6 \mathrm{~kJ}
$$

Then, for the "reverse" reaction, the enthalpy change is also "reversed":

$$
2 \mathrm{HCl}(g) \longrightarrow \mathrm{H}_{2}(g)+\mathrm{Cl}_{2}(g) \quad \Delta H=+184.6 \mathrm{~kJ}
$$

#### Example 5.13 

**Stepwise Calculation of $\Delta H_{\mathrm{f}}^{\circ}$ Using Hess's Law**

Determine the enthalpy of formation, $\Delta H_{\mathrm{f}}^{\circ}$, of $\mathrm{FeCl}_{3}(\mathrm{~s})$ from the enthalpy changes of the following twostep process that occurs under standard state conditions:

$$
\begin{array}{rlrl}
\mathrm{Fe}(s)+\mathrm{Cl}_{2}(g) & \longrightarrow \mathrm{FeCl}_{2}(s) & \Delta H^{\circ}=-341.8 \mathrm{~kJ} \\
\mathrm{FeCl}_{2}(s)+\frac{1}{2} \mathrm{Cl}_{2}(g) & \longrightarrow \mathrm{FeCl}_{3}(s) & \Delta H^{\circ}=-57.7 \mathrm{~kJ}
\end{array}
$$

**Solution**

We are trying to find the standard enthalpy of formation of $\mathrm{FeCl}_{3}(s)$, which is equal to $\Delta H^{\circ}$ for the reaction:

$$
\mathrm{Fe}(s)+\frac{3}{2} \mathrm{Cl}_{2}(g) \longrightarrow \mathrm{FeCl}_{3}(s) \quad \Delta H_{\mathrm{f}}^{\circ}=?
$$

Looking at the reactions, we see that the reaction for which we want to find $\Delta H^{\circ}$ is the sum of the two reactions with known $\Delta H$ values, so we must sum their $\Delta H \mathrm{~s}$ :

$$
\begin{array}{ll}
\mathrm{Fe}(s)+\mathrm{Cl}_{2}(g) \longrightarrow \mathrm{FeCl}_{2}(s) & \Delta H^{\circ}=-341.8 \mathrm{~kJ} \\
\frac{\mathrm{FeCl}_{2}(s)+\frac{1}{2} \mathrm{Cl}_{2}(g) \longrightarrow \mathrm{FeCl}_{3}(s)}{\mathrm{Fe}(s)+\frac{1}{2} \mathrm{Cl}_{2}(g) \longrightarrow \mathrm{FeCl}_{3}(s)} & \frac{\Delta H^{\circ}=-57.7 \mathrm{~kJ}}{\Delta H^{\circ}=-399.5 \mathrm{~kJ}}
\end{array}
$$

The enthalpy of formation, $\Delta H_{\mathrm{f}}^{\circ}$, of $\mathrm{FeCl}_{3}(\mathrm{~s})$ is $-399.5 \mathrm{~kJ} / \mathrm{mol}$.

**Check Your Learning**

\mathrm{N}_{2}(g)+\mathrm{O}_{2}(g) & \longrightarrow 2 \mathrm{NO}(g) & \Delta H & =180.5 \mathrm{~kJ} \\
\mathrm{NO}(g)+\frac{1}{2} \mathrm{O}_{2}(g) & \longrightarrow \mathrm{NO}_{2}(g) & \Delta H & =-57.06 \mathrm{~kJ}
\end{array}
$$

Answer: 66.4 kJ
Here is a less straightforward example that illustrates the thought process involved in solving many Hess's law problems. It shows how we can find many standard enthalpies of formation (and other values of $\Delta H$ ) if they are difficult to determine experimentally.

#### Example 5.14

**A More Challenging Problem Using Hess's Law**

Chlorine monofluoride can react with fluorine to form chlorine trifluoride:

(i) $\mathrm{ClF}(g)+\mathrm{F}_{2}(g) \longrightarrow \mathrm{ClF}_{3}(g) \quad \Delta H^{\circ}=$ ?

Use the reactions here to determine the $\Delta H^{\circ}$ for reaction (i):
(ii) $2 \mathrm{OF}_{2}(g) \longrightarrow \mathrm{O}_{2}(g)+2 \mathrm{~F}_{2}(g) \quad \Delta H_{(i i)}^{\circ}=-49.4 \mathrm{~kJ}$
(iii) $2 \mathrm{ClF}(g)+\mathrm{O}_{2}(g) \longrightarrow \mathrm{Cl}_{2} \mathrm{O}(g)+\mathrm{OF}_{2}(g) \quad \Delta H_{(i i i)}^{\circ}=+205.6 \mathrm{~kJ}$
(iv) $\mathrm{ClF}_{3}(g)+\mathrm{O}_{2}(g) \longrightarrow \frac{1}{2} \mathrm{Cl}_{2} \mathrm{O}(g)+\frac{3}{2} \mathrm{OF}_{2}(g) \quad \Delta H_{(i v)}^{\circ}=+266.7 \mathrm{~kJ}$

**Solution** 

Our goal is to manipulate and combine reactions (ii), (iii), and (iv) such that they add up to reaction (i). Going from left to right in (i), we first see that $\mathrm{ClF}(g)$ is needed as a reactant. This can be obtained by multiplying reaction (iii) by $\frac{1}{2}$, which means that the $\Delta H^{\circ}$ change is also multiplied by $\frac{1}{2}$ :

$$
\mathrm{ClF}(g)+\frac{1}{2} \mathrm{O}_{2}(g) \longrightarrow \frac{1}{2} \mathrm{Cl}_{2} \mathrm{O}(g)+\frac{1}{2} \mathrm{OF}_{2}(g) \quad \Delta H^{\circ}=\frac{1}{2}(205.6)=+102.8 \mathrm{~kJ}
$$

Next, we see that $\mathrm{F}_{2}$ is also needed as a reactant. To get this, reverse and halve reaction (ii), which means that the $\Delta H^{\circ}$ changes sign and is halved:

$$
\frac{1}{2} \mathrm{O}_{2}(g)+\mathrm{F}_{2}(g) \longrightarrow \mathrm{OF}_{2}(g) \quad \Delta H^{\circ}=+24.7 \mathrm{~kJ}
$$

To get $\mathrm{ClF}_{3}$ as a product, reverse (iv), changing the sign of $\Delta H^{\circ}$ :

$$
\frac{1}{2} \mathrm{Cl}_{2} \mathrm{O}(g)+\frac{3}{2} \mathrm{OF}_{2}(g) \longrightarrow \mathrm{ClF}_{3}(g)+\mathrm{O}_{2}(g) \quad \Delta H^{\circ}=-266.7 \mathrm{~kJ}
$$

Now check to make sure that these reactions add up to the reaction we want:
$$
\begin{align*}
\mathrm{ClF(g)} + \frac{1}{2}\mathrm{O_2(g)} &\longrightarrow \frac{1}{2}\mathrm{Cl_2O(g)} + \frac{1}{2}\mathrm{OF_2(g)} \qquad \Delta H^\circ = +102.8~\mathrm{kJ} \\
\frac{1}{2}\mathrm{O_2(g)} + \mathrm{F_2(g)} &\longrightarrow \mathrm{OF_2(g)} \qquad \Delta H^\circ = +24.7~\mathrm{kJ} \\
\frac{1}{2}\mathrm{Cl_2O(g)} + \frac{3}{2}\mathrm{OF_2(g)} &\longrightarrow \mathrm{ClF_3(g)} + \mathrm{O_2(g)} \qquad \Delta H^\circ = -266.7~\mathrm{kJ} \\
\hline
\mathrm{ClF(g)} + \mathrm{F_2(g)} &\longrightarrow \mathrm{ClF_3(g)} \qquad \Delta H^\circ = -139.2~\mathrm{kJ}
\end{align*}
$$

Reactants $\frac{1}{2} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ and $\frac{1}{2} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ cancel out product $\mathrm{O}_{2}$; product $\frac{1}{2} \mathrm{Cl}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ cancels reactant $\frac{1}{2} \mathrm{Cl}_{2} \mathrm{O}$; and reactant $\frac{3}{2} \mathrm{OF}_{2}$ is cancelled by products $\frac{1}{2} \mathrm{OF}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{OF}_{2}$. This leaves only reactants $\mathrm{ClF}(g)$ and $\mathrm{F}_{2}(g)$ and product $\mathrm{ClF}_{3}(g)$, which are what we want. Since summing these three modified reactions yields the reaction of interest, summing the three modified $\Delta H^{\circ}$ values will give the desired $\Delta H^{\circ}$ :

$$
\Delta H^{\circ}=(+102.8 \mathrm{~kJ})+(24.7 \mathrm{~kJ})+(-266.7 \mathrm{~kJ})=-139.2 \mathrm{~kJ}
$$

**Check Your Learning**

Aluminum chloride can be formed from its elements:
(i) $2 \mathrm{Al}(s)+3 \mathrm{Cl}_{2}(g) \longrightarrow 2 \mathrm{AlCl}_{3}(s) \quad \Delta H^{\circ}=$ ?

Use the reactions here to determine the $\Delta H^{\circ}$ for reaction (i):
(ii) $\mathrm{HCl}(g) \longrightarrow \mathrm{HCl}(a q) \quad \Delta H_{(i i)}^{\circ}=-74.8 \mathrm{~kJ}$
(iii) $\mathrm{H}_{2}(g)+\mathrm{Cl}_{2}(g) \longrightarrow 2 \mathrm{HCl}(g) \quad \Delta H_{(i i i)}^{\circ}=-185 \mathrm{~kJ}$
(iv) $\mathrm{AlCl}_{3}(a q) \longrightarrow \mathrm{AlCl}_{3}(s) \quad \Delta H_{(i v)}^{\circ}=+323 \mathrm{~kJ} / \mathrm{mol}$
(v) $2 \mathrm{Al}(s)+6 \mathrm{HCl}(a q) \longrightarrow 2 \mathrm{AlCl}_{3}(a q)+3 \mathrm{H}_{2}(g) \quad \Delta H_{(v)}^{\circ}=-1049 \mathrm{~kJ}$

We also can use Hess's law to determine the enthalpy change of any reaction if the corresponding enthalpies of formation of the reactants and products are available. The stepwise reactions we consider are: (i) decompositions of the reactants into their component elements (for which the enthalpy changes are proportional to the negative of the enthalpies of formation of the reactants), followed by (ii) re-combinations of the elements to give the products (with the enthalpy changes proportional to the enthalpies of formation of the products). The standard enthalpy change of the overall reaction is therefore equal to: (ii) the sum of the standard enthalpies of formation of all the products plus (i) the sum of the negatives of the standard enthalpies of formation of the reactants. This is usually rearranged slightly to be written as follows, with $\sum$ representing "the sum of" and $n$ standing for the stoichiometric coefficients:

$$
\Delta H_{\text {reaction }}^{\circ}=\sum n \times \Delta H_{\mathrm{f}}^{\circ} \text { (products) }-\sum n \times \Delta H_{\mathrm{f}}^{\circ} \text { (reactants) }
$$

The following example shows in detail why this equation is valid, and how to use it to calculate the enthalpy change for a reaction of interest.

#### Example 5.15 

**Using Hess's Law**

What is the standard enthalpy change for the reaction:

$$
3 \mathrm{NO}_{2}(g)+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}(l) \longrightarrow 2 \mathrm{HNO}_{3}(a q)+\mathrm{NO}(g) \quad \Delta H^{\circ}=?
$$

**Solution: Using the Equation**

Use the special form of Hess's law given previously, and values from Appendix G:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \Delta H_{\text {reaction }}^{\circ}=\sum n \times \Delta H_{\mathrm{f}}^{\circ} \text { (products) }-\sum n \times \Delta H_{\mathrm{f}}^{\circ} \text { (reactants) } \\
= & {\left[2 \text { molHNO }_{3}(a q) \times \frac{-207.4 \mathrm{~kJ}}{\text { molHNO }_{3}(a q)}+1 \text { mol NO }(g) \times \frac{+90.2 \mathrm{~kJ}}{\text { mol NO }(g)}\right] } \\
- & {\left[3 \text { molNO }_{2}(g) \times \frac{+33.2 \mathrm{~kJ}}{\text { molNO }_{2}(g)}+1 \text { molH }_{2} \mathrm{O}(l) \times \frac{-285.8 \mathrm{~kJ}}{\text { molH }_{2} \mathrm{O}(l)}\right] } \\
= & 2(-207.4 \mathrm{~kJ})+1(+90.2 \mathrm{~kJ})-3(+33.2 \mathrm{~kJ})-1(-285.8 \mathrm{~kJ}) \\
= & -138.4 \mathrm{~kJ}
\end{aligned}
$$

**Solution: Supporting Why the General Equation Is Valid**

Alternatively, we can write this reaction as the sum of the decompositions of $3 \mathrm{NO}_{2}(g)$ and $1 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}(l)$ into their constituent elements, and the formation of $2 \mathrm{HNO}_{3}(a q)$ and $1 \mathrm{NO}(g)$ from their constituent elements. Writing out these reactions, and noting their relationships to the $\Delta H_{\mathrm{f}}^{\circ}$ values for these compounds (from Appendix G ), we have:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& 3 \mathrm{NO}_{2}(g) \longrightarrow 3 / 2 \mathrm{~N}_{2}(g)+3 \mathrm{O}_{2}(g) \quad \Delta H_{1}^{\circ}=-99.6 \mathrm{~kJ} \\
& \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}(l) \longrightarrow \mathrm{H}_{2}(g)+\frac{1}{2} \mathrm{O}_{2}(g) \quad \Delta H_{2}^{\circ}=+285.8 \mathrm{~kJ}\left[-1 \times \Delta H_{\mathrm{f}}^{\circ}\left(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}\right)\right] \\
& \mathrm{H}_{2}(g)+\mathrm{N}_{2}(g)+3 \mathrm{O}_{2}(g) \longrightarrow 2 \mathrm{HNO}_{3}(a q) \quad \Delta H_{3}^{\circ}=-414.8 \mathrm{~kJ}\left[2 \times \Delta H_{\mathrm{f}}^{\circ}\left(\mathrm{HNO}_{3}\right)\right] \\
& \frac{1}{2} \mathrm{~N}_{2}(g)+\frac{1}{2} \mathrm{O}_{2}(g) \longrightarrow \mathrm{NO}(g) \quad \Delta H_{4}^{\circ}=+90.2 \mathrm{~kJ}[1 \times(\mathrm{NO})]
\end{aligned}
$$

Summing these reaction equations gives the reaction we are interested in:

$$
3 \mathrm{NO}_{2}(g)+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}(l) \longrightarrow 2 \mathrm{HNO}_{3}(a q)+\mathrm{NO}(g)
$$

Summing their enthalpy changes gives the value we want to determine:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\Delta H_{\mathrm{txn}}^{\circ} & =\Delta H_{1}^{\circ}+\Delta H_{2}^{\circ}+\Delta H_{3}^{\circ}+\Delta H_{4}^{\circ}=(-99.6 \mathrm{~kJ})+(+285.8 \mathrm{~kJ})+(-414.8 \mathrm{~kJ})+(+90.2 \mathrm{~kJ}) \\
& =-138.4 \mathrm{~kJ}
\end{aligned}
$$

So the standard enthalpy change for this reaction is $\Delta H^{\circ}=-138.4 \mathrm{~kJ}$.
Note that this result was obtained by (1) multiplying the $\Delta H_{I}^{\circ}$ of each product by its stoichiometric coefficient and summing those values, (2) multiplying the $\Delta H_{I}^{\circ}$ of each reactant by its stoichiometric coefficient and summing those values, and then (3) subtracting the result found in (2) from the result found in (1). This is also the procedure in using the general equation, as shown.

### Summary

#### 5.1 Energy Basics

Energy is the capacity to supply heat or do work (applying a force to move matter). Kinetic energy (KE) is the energy of motion; potential energy is energy due to relative position, composition, or condition. When energy is converted from one form into another, energy is neither created nor destroyed (law of conservation of energy or first law of thermodynamics).

The thermal energy of matter is due to the kinetic energies of its constituent atoms or molecules. Temperature is an intensive property of matter reflecting hotness or coldness that increases as the average kinetic energy increases. Heat is the transfer of thermal energy between objects at different temperatures. Chemical and physical processes can absorb heat (endothermic) or release heat (exothermic). The SI unit of energy, heat, and work is the joule (J).

Specific heat and heat capacity are measures of the energy needed to change the temperature of a substance or object. The amount of heat absorbed or released by a substance depends directly on the type of substance, its mass, and the temperature change it undergoes.

#### 5.2 Calorimetry

Calorimetry is used to measure the amount of thermal energy transferred in a chemical or physical process. This requires careful measurement of the temperature change that occurs during the process and the masses of the system and surroundings. These measured quantities are then used to compute the amount of heat produced or consumed in the process using known mathematical relations.

Calorimeters are designed to minimize energy exchange between their contents and the external environment. They range from simple coffee cup calorimeters used by introductory chemistry students to sophisticated bomb calorimeters used to determine the energy content of food.

#### 5.3 Enthalpy 

If a chemical change is carried out at constant pressure and the only work done is caused by expansion or contraction, $q$ for the change is called the enthalpy change with the symbol $\Delta H$, or $\Delta H^{\circ}$ for reactions occurring under standard state conditions at 298 K . The value of $\Delta H$ for a reaction in one direction is equal in magnitude, but opposite in sign, to $\Delta H$ for the reaction in the opposite direction, and $\Delta H$ is directly proportional to the quantity of reactants and products. The standard enthalpy of formation, $\Delta H_{F}^{\circ}$, is the enthalpy change accompanying the formation of 1 mole of a substance from the elements in their most stable states at 1 bar and 298.15 K . If the enthalpies of formation are available for the reactants and products of a reaction, the enthalpy change can be calculated using Hess's law: If a process can be written as the sum of several stepwise processes, the enthalpy change of the total process equals the sum of the enthalpy changes of the various steps.

During a recent winter month in Sheboygan, Wisconsin, it was necessary to obtain 3500 kWh of heat provided by a natural gas furnace with $89 \%$ efficiency to keep a small house warm (the efficiency of a gas furnace is the percent of the heat produced by combustion that is transferred into the house).
(a) Assume that natural gas is pure methane and determine the volume of natural gas in cubic feet that was required to heat the house. The average temperature of the natural gas was $56^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$; at this temperature and a pressure of 1 atm , natural gas has a density of $0.681 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{L}$.
(b) How many gallons of LPG (liquefied petroleum gas) would be required to replace the natural gas used? Assume the LPG is liquid propane $\left[\mathrm{C}_{3} \mathrm{H}_{8}\right.$ : density, $0.5318 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{mL}$; enthalpy of combustion, $2219 \mathrm{~kJ} / \mathrm{mol}$ for the formation of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}(g)$ and $\left.\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}(l)\right]$ and the furnace used to burn the LPG has the same efficiency as the gas furnace.
(c) What mass of carbon dioxide is produced by combustion of the methane used to heat the house?
(d) What mass of water is produced by combustion of the methane used to heat the house?
(e) What volume of air is required to provide the oxygen for the combustion of the methane used to heat the house? Air contains $23 \%$ oxygen by mass. The average density of air during the month was $1.22 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{L}$.
(f) How many kilowatt-hours ( $1 \mathrm{kWh}=3.6 \times 10^{6} \mathrm{~J}$ ) of electricity would be required to provide the heat necessary to heat the house? Note electricity is $100 \%$ efficient in producing heat inside a house.
(g) Although electricity is $100 \%$ efficient in producing heat inside a house, production and distribution of electricity is not $100 \%$ efficient. The efficiency of production and distribution of electricity produced in a coal-fired power plant is about $40 \%$. A certain type of coal provides 2.26 kWh per pound upon combustion. What mass of this coal in kilograms will be required to produce the electrical energy necessary to heat the house if the efficiency of generation and distribution is $40 \%$ ?
