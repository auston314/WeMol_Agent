### Introduction

Imagine a beach populated with sunbathers and swimmers. As those basking in the sun get too hot, they enter the surf to swim and cool off. As the swimmers tire, they return to the beach to rest. If the rate at which sunbathers enter the surf were to equal the rate at which swimmers return to the sand, then the numbers (though not the identities) of sunbathers and swimmers would remain constant. This scenario illustrates a dynamic phenomenon known as equilibrium, in which opposing processes occur at equal rates. Chemical and physical processes are subject to this phenomenon; these processes are at equilibrium when the forward and reverse reaction rates are equal. Equilibrium systems are pervasive in nature; the various reactions involving carbon dioxide dissolved in blood are examples (see Figure 13.1). This chapter provides a thorough introduction to the essential aspects of chemical equilibria.

### 13.1 Chemical Equilibria 

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

- Describe the nature of equilibrium systems
- Explain the dynamic nature of a chemical equilibrium

The convention for writing chemical equations involves placing reactant formulas on the left side of a reaction arrow and product formulas on the right side. By this convention, and the definitions of "reactant" and "product," a chemical equation represents the reaction in question as proceeding from left to right. Reversible reactions, however, may proceed in both forward (left to right) and reverse (right to left) directions. When the rates of the forward and reverse reactions are equal, the concentrations of the reactant and product species remain constant over time and the system is at equilibrium. The relative concentrations of reactants and products in equilibrium systems vary greatly; some systems contain mostly products at equilibrium, some contain mostly reactants, and some contain appreciable amounts of both.

Figure 13.2 illustrates fundamental equilibrium concepts using the reversible decomposition of colorless dinitrogen tetroxide to yield brown nitrogen dioxide, an elementary reaction described by the equation:

$$
\mathrm{N}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{4}(g) \rightleftharpoons 2 \mathrm{NO}_{2}(g)
$$

Note that a special double arrow is used to emphasize the reversible nature of the reaction.

![Image](Chapter_13_images/img-1.jpeg)

Figure 13.2 (a) A sealed tube containing colorless $\mathrm{N}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{4}$ darkens as it decomposes to yield brown $\mathrm{NO}_{2}$. (b) Changes in concentration over time as the decomposition reaction achieves equilibrium. (c) At equilibrium, the forward and reverse reaction rates are equal.

For this elementary process, rate laws for the forward and reverse reactions may be derived directly from the reaction stoichiometry:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text { rate }_{f} & =k_{f}\left[\mathrm{~N}_{-2} \mathrm{O}_{4}\right] \\
\text { rate }_{r} & =k_{r}\left[\mathrm{NO}_{2}\right]^{2}
\end{aligned}
$$

As the reaction begins $(t=0)$, the concentration of the $\mathrm{N}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{4}$ reactant is finite and that of the $\mathrm{NO}_{2}$ product is zero, so the forward reaction proceeds at a finite rate while the reverse reaction rate is zero. As time passes, $\mathrm{N}_{-2} \mathrm{O}_{4}$ is consumed and its concentration falls, while $\mathrm{NO}_{2}$ is produced and its concentration increases (Figure 13.2b). The decreasing concentration of the reactant slows the forward reaction rate, and the increasing product concentration speeds the reverse reaction rate (Figure 13.2c). This process continues until the forward and reverse reaction rates

become equal, at which time the reaction has reached equilibrium, as characterized by constant concentrations of its reactants and products (shaded areas of Figure 13.2b and Figure 13.2c). It's important to emphasize that chemical equilibria are dynamic; a reaction at equilibrium has not "stopped," but is proceeding in the forward and reverse directions at the same rate. This dynamic nature is essential to understanding equilibrium behavior as discussed in this and subsequent chapters of the text.

![Image](Chapter_13_images/img-2.jpeg)

Figure 13.3 A two-person juggling act illustrates the dynamic aspect of chemical equilibria. Each person is throwing and catching clubs at the same rate, and each holds a (approximately) constant number of clubs.

Physical changes, such as phase transitions, are also reversible and may establish equilibria. This concept was introduced in another chapter of this text through discussion of the vapor pressure of a condensed phase (liquid or solid). As one example, consider the vaporization of bromine:

$$
\operatorname{Br}_{2}(l) \rightleftharpoons \operatorname{Br}_{2}(g)
$$

When liquid bromine is added to an otherwise empty container and the container is sealed, the forward process depicted above (vaporization) will commence and continue at a roughly constant rate as long as the exposed surface area of the liquid and its temperature remain constant. As increasing amounts of gaseous bromine are produced, the rate of the reverse process (condensation) will increase until it equals the rate of vaporization and equilibrium is established. A photograph showing this phase transition equilibrium is provided in Figure 13.4.

### 13.2 Equilibrium Constants 

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

- Derive reaction quotients from chemical equations representing homogeneous and heterogeneous reactions
- Calculate values of reaction quotients and equilibrium constants, using concentrations and pressures
- Relate the magnitude of an equilibrium constant to properties of the chemical system

The status of a reversible reaction is conveniently assessed by evaluating its reaction quotient $(\mathbf{Q})$. For a reversible reaction described by

$$
m \mathrm{~A}+n \mathrm{~B}+\rightleftharpoons x \mathrm{C}+y \mathrm{D}
$$

the reaction quotient is derived directly from the stoichiometry of the balanced equation as

$$
Q_{c}=\frac{[\mathrm{C}]^{x}[\mathrm{D}]^{y}}{[\mathrm{~A}]^{m}[\mathrm{~B}]^{n}}
$$

where the subscript c denotes the use of molar concentrations in the expression. If the reactants and products are gaseous, a reaction quotient may be similarly derived using partial pressures:

$$
Q_{p}=\frac{P_{\mathrm{C}}^{x} P_{\mathrm{D}}^{y}}{P_{\mathrm{A}}^{\mathrm{m}} P_{\mathrm{B}}^{\mathrm{n}}}
$$

Note that the reaction quotient equations above are a simplification of more rigorous expressions that use relative values for concentrations and pressures rather than absolute values. These relative concentration and pressure values are dimensionless (they have no units); consequently, so are the reaction quotients. For purposes of this introductory text, it will suffice to use the simplified equations and to disregard units when computing $Q$. In most cases, this will

introduce only modest errors in calculations involving reaction quotients.

#### Example 13.1 

**Writing Reaction Quotient Expressions**

Write the concentration-based reaction quotient expression for each of the following reactions:
(a) $3 \mathrm{O}_{2}(g) \rightleftharpoons 2 \mathrm{O}_{3}(g)$
(b) $\mathrm{N}_{2}(g)+3 \mathrm{H}_{2}(g) \rightleftharpoons 2 \mathrm{NH}_{3}(g)$
(c) $4 \mathrm{NH}_{3}(g)+7 \mathrm{O}_{2}(g) \rightleftharpoons 4 \mathrm{NO}_{2}(g)+6 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}(g)$

**Solution**

(a) $Q_{c}=\frac{\left[\mathrm{O}_{3}\right]^{2}}{\left[\mathrm{O}_{2}\right]^{3}}$
(b) $Q_{c}=\frac{\left[\mathrm{NH}_{3}\right]^{2}}{\left[\mathrm{~N}_{2}\right]\left[\mathrm{H}_{2}\right]^{3}}$
(c) $Q_{c}=\frac{\left[\mathrm{NO}_{2}\right]^{4}\left[\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}\right]^{6}}{\left[\mathrm{NH}_{3}\right]^{4}\left[\mathrm{O}_{2}\right]^{7}}$

**Check Your Learning**

Write the concentration-based reaction quotient expression for each of the following reactions:
(a) $2 \mathrm{SO}_{2}(g)+\mathrm{O}_{2}(g) \rightleftharpoons 2 \mathrm{SO}_{3}(g)$
(b) $\mathrm{C}_{4} \mathrm{H}_{8}(g) \rightleftharpoons 2 \mathrm{C}_{2} \mathrm{H}_{4}(g)$
(c) $2 \mathrm{C}_{4} \mathrm{H}_{10}(g)+13 \mathrm{O}_{2}(g) \rightleftharpoons 8 \mathrm{CO}_{2}(g)+10 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}(g)$

Answer: (a) $Q_{c}=\frac{\left[\mathrm{SO}_{3}\right]^{2}}{\left[\mathrm{SO}_{2}\right]^{2}\left[\mathrm{O}_{2}\right]}$; (b) $Q_{c}=\frac{\left[\mathrm{C}_{2} \mathrm{H}_{4}\right]^{2}}{\left[\mathrm{C}_{4} \mathrm{H}_{8}\right]}$; (c) $Q_{c}=\frac{\left[\mathrm{CO}_{2}\right]^{8}\left[\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}\right]^{10}}{\left[\mathrm{C}_{4} \mathrm{H}_{10}\right]^{2}\left[\mathrm{O}_{2}\right]^{13}}$

![Image](Chapter_13_images/img-4.jpeg)

Figure 13.5 Changes in concentrations and $Q_{c}$ for a chemical equilibrium achieved beginning with (a) a mixture of reactants only and (b) products only.

The numerical value of $Q$ varies as a reaction proceeds towards equilibrium; therefore, it can serve as a useful indicator of the reaction's status. To illustrate this point, consider the oxidation of sulfur dioxide:

$$
2 \mathrm{SO}_{2}(g)+\mathrm{O}_{2}(g) \rightleftharpoons 2 \mathrm{SO}_{3}(g)
$$

Two different experimental scenarios are depicted in Figure 13.5, one in which this reaction is initiated with a mixture of reactants only, $\mathrm{SO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{O}_{2}$, and another that begins with only product, $\mathrm{SO}_{3}$. For the reaction that begins with a mixture of reactants only, $Q$ is initially equal to zero:

$$
Q_{c}=\frac{\left[\mathrm{SO}_{3}\right]^{2}}{\left[\mathrm{SO}_{2}\right]^{2}\left[\mathrm{O}_{2}\right]}=\frac{0^{2}}{\left[\mathrm{SO}_{2}\right]^{2}\left[\mathrm{O}_{2}\right]}=0
$$

As the reaction proceeds toward equilibrium in the forward direction, reactant concentrations decrease (as does the denominator of $Q_{c}$ ), product concentration increases (as does the numerator of $Q_{c}$ ), and the reaction quotient consequently increases. When equilibrium is achieved, the concentrations of reactants and product remain constant, as does the value of $Q_{c}$.

If the reaction begins with only product present, the value of $Q_{c}$ is initially undefined (immeasurably large, or

infinite):

$$
Q_{c}=\frac{\left[\mathrm{SO}_{3}\right]^{2}}{\left[\mathrm{SO}_{2}\right]^{2}\left[\mathrm{O}_{2}\right]}=\frac{\left[\mathrm{SO}_{3}\right]^{2}}{0 \rightarrow \infty}
$$

In this case, the reaction proceeds toward equilibrium in the reverse direction. The product concentration and the numerator of $Q_{c}$ decrease with time, the reactant concentrations and the denominator of $Q_{c}$ increase, and the reaction quotient consequently decreases until it becomes constant at equilibrium.
The constant value of $Q$ exhibited by a system at equilibrium is called the equilibrium constant, $\boldsymbol{K}$ :

$$
K \equiv Q \text { at equilibrium }
$$

Comparison of the data plots in Figure 13.5 shows that both experimental scenarios resulted in the same value for the equilibrium constant. This is a general observation for all equilibrium systems, known as the law of mass action: At a given temperature, the reaction quotient for a system at equilibrium is constant.

#### Example 13.2 

**Evaluating a Reaction Quotient**

Gaseous nitrogen dioxide forms dinitrogen tetroxide according to this equation:

$$
2 \mathrm{NO}_{2}(g) \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{N}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{4}(g)
$$

When $0.10 \mathrm{~mol} \mathrm{NO}_{2}$ is added to a $1.0-\mathrm{L}$ flask at $25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, the concentration changes so that at equilibrium, $\left[\mathrm{NO}_{2}\right]=0.016 \mathrm{M}$ and $\left[\mathrm{N}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{4}\right]=0.042 \mathrm{M}$.
(a) What is the value of the reaction quotient before any reaction occurs?
(b) What is the value of the equilibrium constant for the reaction?

## Solution

As for all equilibrium calculations in this text, use the simplified equations for $Q$ and $K$ and disregard any concentration or pressure units, as noted previously in this section.
(a) Before any product is formed, $\left[\mathrm{NO}_{2}\right]=\frac{0.10 \mathrm{~mol}}{1.0 \mathrm{~L}}=0.10 \mathrm{M}$, and $\left[\mathrm{N}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{4}\right]=0 \mathrm{M}$. Thus,

$$
Q_{c}=\frac{\left[\mathrm{N}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{4}\right]}{\left[\mathrm{NO}_{2}\right]^{2}}=\frac{0}{0.10^{2}}=0
$$

(b) At equilibrium, $K_{c}=Q_{c}=\frac{\left[\mathrm{N}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{4}\right]}{\left[\mathrm{NO}_{2}\right]^{2}}=\frac{0.042}{0.016^{2}}=1.6 \times 10^{2}$. The equilibrium constant is $1.6 \times 10^{2}$.

For the reaction $2 \mathrm{SO}_{2}(g)+\mathrm{O}_{2}(g) \rightleftharpoons 2 \mathrm{SO}_{3}(g)$, the concentrations at equilibrium are $\left[\mathrm{SO}_{2}\right]=0.90 \mathrm{M},\left[\mathrm{O}_{2}\right]$ $=0.35 M$, and $\left[\mathrm{SO}_{3}\right]=1.1 M$. What is the value of the equilibrium constant, $K_{c}$ ?

Answer: $K_{c}=4.3$
By its definition, the magnitude of an equilibrium constant explicitly reflects the composition of a reaction mixture at equilibrium, and it may be interpreted with regard to the extent of the forward reaction. A reaction exhibiting a large $K$ will reach equilibrium when most of the reactant has been converted to product, whereas a small $K$ indicates the reaction achieves equilibrium after very little reactant has been converted. It's important to keep in mind that the magnitude of $K$ does not indicate how rapidly or slowly equilibrium will be reached. Some equilibria are established so quickly as to be nearly instantaneous, and others so slowly that no perceptible change is observed over the course of days, years, or longer.

The equilibrium constant for a reaction can be used to predict the behavior of mixtures containing its reactants and/or

products. As demonstrated by the sulfur dioxide oxidation process described above, a chemical reaction will proceed in whatever direction is necessary to achieve equilibrium. Comparing $Q$ to $K$ for an equilibrium system of interest allows prediction of what reaction (forward or reverse), if any, will occur.
To further illustrate this important point, consider the reversible reaction shown below:

$$
\mathrm{CO}(g)+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}(g) \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{CO}_{2}(g)+\mathrm{H}_{2}(g) \quad K_{c}=0.640 \quad \mathrm{~T}=800^{\circ} \mathrm{C}
$$

The bar charts in Figure 13.6 represent changes in reactant and product concentrations for three different reaction mixtures. The reaction quotients for mixtures 1 and 3 are initially lesser than the reaction's equilibrium constant, so each of these mixtures will experience a net forward reaction to achieve equilibrium. The reaction quotient for mixture 2 is initially greater than the equilibrium constant, so this mixture will proceed in the reverse direction until equilibrium is established.

![Image](Chapter_13_images/img-5.jpeg)

Figure 13.6 Compositions of three mixtures before $\left(Q_{c} \neq K_{c}\right)$ and after $\left(Q_{c}=K_{c}\right)$ equilibrium is established for the reaction $\mathrm{CO}(g)+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}(g) \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{CO}_{2}(g)+\mathrm{H}_{2}(g)$.

#### Example 13.3 

**Predicting the Direction of Reaction**

Given here are the starting concentrations of reactants and products for three experiments involving this reaction:

$$
\begin{gathered}
\mathrm{CO}(g)+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}(g) \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{CO}_{2}(g)+\mathrm{H}_{2}(g) \\
K_{c}=0.64
\end{gathered}
$$

Determine in which direction the reaction proceeds as it goes to equilibrium in each of the three experiments shown.

| Reactants/Products | Experiment 1 | Experiment 2 | Experiment 3 |
| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| $[\mathrm{CO}]_{\mathrm{i}}$ | 0.020 M | 0.011 M | 0.0094 M |
| $\left[\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}\right]_{\mathrm{i}}$ | 0.020 M | 0.0011 M | 0.0025 M |
| $\left[\mathrm{CO}_{2}\right]_{\mathrm{i}}$ | 0.0040 M | 0.037 M | 0.0015 M |
| $\left[\mathrm{H}_{2}\right]_{\mathrm{i}}$ | 0.0040 M | 0.046 M | 0.0076 M |

**Solution**

Experiment 1:

$$
Q_{c}=\frac{\left[\mathrm{CO}_{2}\right]\left[\mathrm{H}_{2}\right]}{[\mathrm{CO}]\left[\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}\right]}=\frac{(0.0040)(0.0040)}{(0.020)(0.020)}=0.040
$$

$Q_{c}<K_{c}(0.040<0.64)$
The reaction will proceed in the forward direction.

Experiment 2:

$$
Q_{c}=\frac{\left[\mathrm{CO}_{2}\right]\left[\mathrm{H}_{2}\right]}{[\mathrm{CO}]\left[\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}\right]}=\frac{(0.037)(0.046)}{(0.011)(0.0011)}=1.4 \times 10^{2}
$$

$Q_{c}>K_{c}(140>0.64)$
The reaction will proceed in the reverse direction.
Experiment 3:

$$
Q_{c}=\frac{\left[\mathrm{CO}_{2}\right]\left[\mathrm{H}_{2}\right]}{[\mathrm{CO}]\left[\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}\right]}=\frac{(0.0015)(0.0076)}{(0.0094)(0.0025)}=0.48
$$

$Q_{c}<K_{c}(0.48<0.64)$
The reaction will proceed in the forward direction.

Calculate the reaction quotient and determine the direction in which each of the following reactions will proceed to reach equilibrium.
(a) A 1.00-L flask containing 0.0500 mol of $\mathrm{NO}(\mathrm{g}), 0.0155 \mathrm{~mol}$ of $\mathrm{Cl} 2(\mathrm{~g})$, and 0.500 mol of NOCl :

$$

$$

$$

(c) A 2.00-L flask containing 230 g of $\mathrm{SO}_{3}(\mathrm{~g})$ :

$$
2 \mathrm{SO}_{3}(g) \rightleftharpoons 2 \mathrm{SO}_{2}(g)+\mathrm{O}_{2}(g) \quad K_{c}=0.230
$$

Answer: (a) $Q_{c}=6.45 \times 10^{3}$, forward. (b) $Q_{c}=0.23$, reverse. (c) $Q_{c}=0$, forward.

#### Homogeneous Equilibria

A homogeneous equilibrium is one in which all reactants and products (and any catalysts, if applicable) are present in the same phase. By this definition, homogeneous equilibria take place in solutions. These solutions are most commonly either liquid or gaseous phases, as shown by the examples below:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \mathrm{C}_{2} \mathrm{H}_{2}(a q)+2 \mathrm{Br}_{2}(a q) \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{C}_{2} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{Br}_{4}(a q) \quad K_{c}=\frac{\left[\mathrm{C}_{5} \mathrm{H}_{5} \mathrm{Br}_{4}\right]}{\left[\mathrm{C}_{2} \mathrm{H}_{2}\right]\left[\mathrm{Br}_{2}\right]^{2}} \\
& \mathrm{I}_{2}(a q)+\mathrm{I}^{-}(a q) \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{I}_{3}{ }^{-}(a q) \quad K_{c}=\frac{\left[\mathrm{I}_{3}{ }^{-}\right]}{\left[\mathrm{I}_{2}\right]\left[\mathrm{I}^{-}\right]} \\
& \mathrm{HF}(a q)+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}(l) \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{H}_{3} \mathrm{O}^{+}(a q)+\mathrm{F}^{-}(a q) \quad K_{c}=\frac{\left[\mathrm{H}_{3} \mathrm{O}^{+}\right]\left[\mathrm{F}^{-}\right]}{[\mathrm{HF}]} \\
& \mathrm{NH}_{3}(a q)+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}(l) \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{NH}_{4}{ }^{+}(a q)+\mathrm{OH}^{-}(a q) \quad K_{c}=\frac{\left[\mathrm{NH}_{4}{ }^{+}\right]\left[\mathrm{OH}^{-}\right]}{\left[\mathrm{NH}_{3}\right]}
\end{aligned}
$$

These examples all involve aqueous solutions, those in which water functions as the solvent. In the last two examples, water also functions as a reactant, but its concentration is not included in the reaction quotient. The reason for this omission is related to the more rigorous form of the $Q$ (or $K$ ) expression mentioned previously in this chapter, in which relative concentrations for liquids and solids are equal to 1 and needn't be included. Consequently, reaction quotients include concentration or pressure terms only for gaseous and solute species.

The equilibria below all involve gas-phase solutions:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \mathrm{C}_{2} \mathrm{H}_{6}(g) \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{C}_{2} \mathrm{H}_{4}(g)+\mathrm{H}_{2}(g) \quad K_{c}=\frac{\left[\mathrm{C}_{2} \mathrm{H}_{4}\right]\left[\mathrm{H}_{2}\right]}{\left[\mathrm{C}_{2} \mathrm{H}_{6}\right]} \\
& 3 \mathrm{O}_{2}(g) \rightleftharpoons 2 \mathrm{O}_{3}(g) \quad K_{c}=\frac{\left[\mathrm{O}_{3}\right]^{2}}{\left[\mathrm{O}_{2}\right]^{3}} \\
& \mathrm{~N}_{2}(g)+3 \mathrm{H}_{2}(g) \rightleftharpoons 2 \mathrm{NH}_{3}(g) \quad K_{c}=\frac{\left[\mathrm{NH}_{3}\right]^{2}}{\left[\mathrm{~N}_{2}\right]\left[\mathrm{H}_{2}\right]^{3}} \\
& \mathrm{C}_{3} \mathrm{H}_{8}(g)+5 \mathrm{O}_{2}(g) \rightleftharpoons 3 \mathrm{CO}_{2}(g)+4 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}(g) \quad K_{c}=\frac{\left[\mathrm{CO}_{2}\right]^{3}\left[\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}\right]^{4}}{\left[\mathrm{C}_{3} \mathrm{H}_{8}\right] \mathrm{O}_{2} \mathrm{H}_{3}^{3}}
\end{aligned}
$$

For gas-phase solutions, the equilibrium constant may be expressed in terms of either the molar concentrations ( $K_{c}$ ) or partial pressures ( $K_{p}$ ) of the reactants and products. A relation between these two $K$ values may be simply derived from the ideal gas equation and the definition of molarity:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& P V=n R T \\
& P=\left(\frac{n}{V}\right) R T \\
& \quad=M R T
\end{aligned}
$$

where $P$ is partial pressure, $V$ is volume, $n$ is molar amount, $R$ is the gas constant, $T$ is temperature, and $M$ is molar concentration.

For the gas-phase reaction $m \mathrm{~A}+n \mathrm{~B} \rightleftharpoons x \mathrm{C}+y \mathrm{D}$ :

$$
\begin{gathered}
K_{P}=\frac{\left(P_{C}\right)^{x}\left(P_{D}\right)^{y}}{\left(P_{A}\right)^{m}\left(P_{B}\right)^{n}} \\
=\frac{([\mathrm{C}] \times R T)^{x}([\mathrm{D}] \times R T)^{y}}{([\mathrm{~A}] \times R T)^{m}([\mathrm{~B}] \times R T)^{n}} \\
=\frac{[\mathrm{C}]^{x}[\mathrm{D}]^{y}}{[\mathrm{~A}]^{m}[\mathrm{~B}]^{n}} \times \frac{(R T)^{x+y}}{(R T)^{m+n}} \\
=K_{c}(R T)^{(x+y) \sim(m+n)} \\
=K_{c}(R T)^{\Delta n}
\end{gathered}
$$

And so, the relationship between $K_{c}$ and $K_{P}$ is

$$
K_{P}=K_{c}(R T)^{\Delta n}
$$

where $\Delta n$ is the difference in the molar amounts of product and reactant gases, in this case:

$$
\Delta n=(x+y)-(m+n)
$$

#### Example 13.4 

**Calculation of $K_{P}$**

Write the equations relating $K_{c}$ to $K_{P}$ for each of the following reactions:
(a) $\mathrm{C}_{2} \mathrm{H}_{6}(g) \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{C}_{2} \mathrm{H}_{4}(g)+\mathrm{H}_{2}(g)$
(b) $\mathrm{CO}(g)+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}(g) \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{CO}_{2}(g)+\mathrm{H}_{2}(g)$
(c) $\mathrm{N}_{2}(g)+3 \mathrm{H}_{2}(g) \rightleftharpoons 2 \mathrm{NH}_{3}(g)$
(d) $K_{c}$ is equal to 0.28 for the following reaction at $900^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ :

$$
\mathrm{CS}_{2}(g)+4 \mathrm{H}_{2}(g) \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{CH}_{4}(g)+2 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{~S}(g)
$$

What is $K_{P}$ at this temperature?

**Solution** 

(a) $\Delta n=(2)-(1)=1$
$K_{P}=K_{c}(R T)^{\Delta n}=K_{c}(R T)^{1}=K_{c}(R T)$
(b) $\Delta n=(2)-(2)=0$
$K_{P}=K_{c}(R T)^{\Delta n}=K_{c}(R T)^{0}=K_{c}$
(c) $\Delta n=(2)-(1+3)=-2$
$K_{P}=K_{c}(R T)^{\Delta n}=K_{c}(R T)^{-2}=\frac{K_{c}}{(R T)^{2}}$
(d) $K_{P}=K_{c}(\mathrm{RT})^{\Delta n}=(0.28)[(0.0821)(1173)]^{-2}=3.0 \times 10^{-5}$

Write the equations relating $K_{c}$ to $K_{P}$ for each of the following reactions:
(a) $2 \mathrm{SO}_{2}(g)+\mathrm{O}_{2}(g) \rightleftharpoons 2 \mathrm{SO}_{3}(g)$
(b) $\mathrm{N}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{4}(g) \rightleftharpoons 2 \mathrm{NO}_{2}(g)$
(c) $\mathrm{C}_{3} \mathrm{H}_{8}(g)+5 \mathrm{O}_{2}(g) \rightleftharpoons 3 \mathrm{CO}_{2}(g)+4 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}(g)$
(d) At $227^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, the following reaction has $K_{c}=0.0952$ :

$$
\mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{OH}(g) \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{CO}(g)+2 \mathrm{H}_{2}(g)
$$

What would be the value of $K_{P}$ at this temperature?

$$
\text { Answer: (a) } K_{P}=K_{c}(R T)^{-1} \text {; (b) } K_{P}=K_{c}(R T) \text {; (c) } K_{P}=K_{c}(R T) \text {; (d) } 160 \text { or } 1.6 \times 10^{2}
$$

#### Heterogeneous Equilibria

A heterogeneous equilibrium involves reactants and products in two or more different phases, as illustrated by the following examples:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \mathrm{PbCl}_{2}(s) \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{Pb}^{2+}(a q)+2 \mathrm{Cl}^{-}(a q) \quad K_{c}=\left[\mathrm{Pb}^{2+}\right]\left[\mathrm{Cl}^{-}\right]^{2} \\
& \mathrm{CaO}(s)+\mathrm{CO}_{2}(g) \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{CaCO}_{3}(s) \quad K_{c}=\frac{1}{\left[\mathrm{CO}_{2}\right]} \\
& \mathrm{C}(s)+2 \mathrm{~S}(g) \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{CS}_{2}(g) \quad K_{c}=\frac{\left[\mathrm{CS}_{2}\right]}{[\mathrm{S}]^{2}} \\
& \mathrm{Br}_{2}(l) \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{Br}_{2}(g) \quad K_{c}=\left[\mathrm{Br}_{2}(g)\right]
\end{aligned}
$$

Again, note that concentration terms are only included for gaseous and solute species, as discussed previously.
Two of the above examples include terms for gaseous species only in their equilibrium constants, and so $K_{p}$ expressions may also be written:

$$

#### Coupled Equilibria

The equilibrium systems discussed so far have all been relatively simple, involving just single reversible reactions. Many systems, however, involve two or more coupled equilibrium reactions, those which have in common one or more reactant or product species. Since the law of mass action allows for a straightforward derivation of equilibrium constant expressions from balanced chemical equations, the K value for a system involving coupled equilibria can

be related to the K values of the individual reactions. Three basic manipulations are involved in this approach, as described below.

1. Changing the direction of a chemical equation essentially swaps the identities of "reactants" and "products," and so the equilibrium constant for the reversed equation is simply the reciprocal of that for the forward equation.

$$
\begin{aligned}
& A \rightleftharpoons B \quad K_{c}=\frac{[B]}{[A]} \\
& B \rightleftharpoons A \quad K_{c^{\prime}}=\frac{[A]}{[B]} \\
& \mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{c}^{\prime}}=\frac{1}{\mathrm{~K}_{\mathrm{c}}}
\end{aligned}
$$

2. Changing the stoichiometric coefficients in an equation by some factor $x$ results in an exponential change in the equilibrium constant by that same factor:

$$
\begin{array}{ll}
A \rightleftharpoons B & K_{c}=\frac{[B]}{[A]} \\
x A \rightleftharpoons x B & K_{c^{\prime}}=\frac{[B]^{x}}{[A]^{x}} \\
K_{c^{\prime}}=K_{c}{ }^{x}
\end{array}
$$

3. Adding two or more equilibrium equations together yields an overall equation whose equilibrium constant is the mathematical product of the individual reaction's K values:

$$
\begin{array}{ll}
A \rightleftharpoons B & K_{c 1}=\frac{[B]}{[A]} \\
B \rightleftharpoons C & K_{c 2}=\frac{[C]}{[B]}
\end{array}
$$

The net reaction for these coupled equilibria is obtained by summing the two equilibrium equations and canceling any redundancies:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& A+B \rightleftharpoons B+C \\
& A+B \rightleftharpoons C \\
& A \rightleftharpoons C
\end{aligned}
$$

Comparing the equilibrium constant for the net reaction to those for the two coupled equilibrium reactions reveals the following relationship:

$$
\begin{gathered}
\mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{c} 1} \mathrm{~K}_{\mathrm{c} 2}=\frac{[\mathrm{B}]}{[\mathrm{A}]} \times \frac{[\mathrm{C}]}{[\mathrm{B}]}=\frac{[\mathrm{B}]}{[\mathrm{A}][\mathrm{B}]}=\frac{[\mathrm{C}]}{[\mathrm{A}]}=\mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{c}^{\prime}} \\
\mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{c}^{\prime}}=\mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{c} 1} \mathrm{~K}_{\mathrm{c} 2}
\end{gathered}
$$

Example 13.5 demonstrates the use of this strategy in describing coupled equilibrium processes.

#### Example 13.5 

**Equilibrium Constants for Coupled Reactions**

A mixture containing nitrogen, hydrogen, and iodine established the following equilibrium at $400^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ :

$$
2 \mathrm{NH}_{3}(g)+3 \mathrm{I}_{2}(g) \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{N}(g)_{2}+6 \mathrm{HI}(g)
$$

Use the information below to calculate Kc for this reaction.

$$
\begin{array}{ll}
\mathrm{N}_{2}(g)+3 \mathrm{H}_{2}(g) \rightleftharpoons 2 \mathrm{NH}_{3}(g) & \mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{c} 1}=0.50 \text { at } 400{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C} \\
\mathrm{H}_{2}(g)+\mathrm{I}_{2}(g) \rightleftharpoons 2 \mathrm{HI}(g) & \mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{c} 2}=50 \text { at } 400{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}
\end{array}
$$

**Solution** 

The equilibrium equation of interest and its K value may be derived from the equations for the two coupled reactions as follows.

Reverse the first coupled reaction equation:

$$
2 \mathrm{NH}_{3}(g) \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{N}_{2}(g)+3 \mathrm{H}_{2}(g) \quad \mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{c} 1^{\prime}}=\frac{1}{\mathrm{~K}_{\mathrm{c} 1}}=\frac{1}{0.50}=2.0
$$

Multiply the second coupled reaction by 3 :

$$
3 \mathrm{H}_{2}(g)+3 \mathrm{I}_{2}(g) \rightleftharpoons 6 \mathrm{HI}(g) \quad \mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{c} 2^{\prime}}=\mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{c} 2}^{3}=50^{3}=1.2 \times 10^{5}
$$

Finally, add the two revised equations:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& 2 \mathrm{NH}_{3}(g)+3 \mathrm{H}_{2}(g)+3 \mathrm{I}_{2}(g) \rightleftharpoons N_{2}(g)+3 \mathrm{H}_{2}(g)+6 \mathrm{HI}(g) \\
& 2 \mathrm{NH}_{3}(g)+3 \mathrm{I}_{2}(g) \rightleftharpoons N_{2}(g)+6 \mathrm{HI}(g) \\
& \mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{c}}=\mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{c} 1^{\prime}} \mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{c} 2^{\prime}}=\left(2.0)\left(1.2 \times 10^{5}\right)=2.5 \times 10^{5}\right.
\end{aligned}
$$

\end{array}
$$

Answer: $\mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{c}} \approx 0.14$

### 13.3 Shifting Equilibria: Le Châtelier's Principle

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

- Describe the ways in which an equilibrium system can be stressed
- Predict the response of a stressed equilibrium using Le Châtelier's principle

A system at equilibrium is in a state of dynamic balance, with forward and reverse reactions taking place at equal rates. If an equilibrium system is subjected to a change in conditions that affects these reaction rates differently (a stress), then the rates are no longer equal and the system is not at equilibrium. The system will subsequently experience a net reaction in the direction of greater rate (a shift) that will re-establish the equilibrium. This phenomenon is summarized by Le Châtelier's principle: if an equilibrium system is stressed, the system will experience a shift in response to the stress that re-establishes equilibrium.

Reaction rates are affected primarily by concentrations, as described by the reaction's rate law, and temperature, as described by the Arrhenius equation. Consequently, changes in concentration and temperature are the two stresses that can shift an equilibrium.

#### Effect of a Change in Concentration

If an equilibrium system is subjected to a change in the concentration of a reactant or product species, the rate of either the forward or the reverse reaction will change. As an example, consider the equilibrium reaction

$$
\mathrm{H}_{2}(g)+\mathrm{I}_{2}(g) \rightleftharpoons 2 \mathrm{HI}(g) \quad K_{c}=50.0 \text { at } 400^{\circ} \mathrm{C}
$$

The rate laws for the forward and reverse reactions are

$$
\begin{array}{ll}
\text { forward } \mathrm{H}_{2}(g)+\mathrm{I}_{2}(g) \rightarrow 2 \mathrm{HI}(g) & \text { rate }_{f}=k_{f}\left[\mathrm{H}_{2}\right]^{m}\left[\mathrm{I}_{2}\right]^{n} \\
\text { reverse } 2 \mathrm{HI}(g) \rightarrow \mathrm{H}_{2}(g)+\mathrm{I}_{2}(g) & \text { rate }_{r}=k_{r}[\mathrm{HI}]^{s}
\end{array}
$$

When this system is at equilibrium, the forward and reverse reaction rates are equal.

$$
\text { rate }_{f}=\text { rate }_{r}
$$

If the system is stressed by adding reactant, either $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ or $\mathrm{I}_{2}$, the resulting increase in concentration causes the rate of the forward reaction to increase, exceeding that of the reverse reaction:

$$
\text { rate }_{f}>\text { rate }_{r}
$$

The system will experience a temporary net reaction in the forward direction to re-establish equilibrium (the equilibrium will shift right). This same shift will result if some product HI is removed from the system, which decreases the rate of the reverse reaction, again resulting in the same imbalance in rates.

The same logic can be used to explain the left shift that results from either removing reactant or adding product to an equilibrium system. These stresses both result in an increased rate for the reverse reaction

$$
\text { rate }_{f}<\text { rate }_{r}
$$

and a temporary net reaction in the reverse direction to re-establish equilibrium.
As an alternative to this kinetic interpretation, the effect of changes in concentration on equilibria can be rationalized in terms of reaction quotients. When the system is at equilibrium,

$$
Q_{c}=\frac{[\mathrm{HI}]^{2}}{\left[\mathrm{H}_{2}\right]\left[\mathrm{I}_{2}\right]}=K_{c}
$$

If reactant is added (increasing the denominator of the reaction quotient) or product is removed (decreasing the numerator), then $Q_{c}<K_{c}$ and the equilibrium will shift right. Note that the three different ways of inducing this stress result in three different changes in the composition of the equilibrium mixture. If $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ is added, the right shift will consume $\mathrm{I}_{2}$ and produce HI as equilibrium is re-established, yielding a mixture with a greater concentrations of $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ and HI and a lesser concentration of $\mathrm{I}_{2}$ than was present before. If $\mathrm{I}_{2}$ is added, the new equilibrium mixture will have greater concentrations of $\mathrm{I}_{2}$ and HI and a lesser concentration of $\mathrm{H}_{2}$. Finally, if HI is removed, the new equilibrium mixture will have greater concentrations of $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{I}_{2}$ and a lesser concentration of HI. Despite these differences in composition, the value of the equilibrium constant will be the same after the stress as it was before (per the law of mass action). The same logic may be applied for stresses involving removing reactants or adding product, in which case $Q_{c}>K_{c}$ and the equilibrium will shift left.

For gas-phase equilibria such as this one, some additional perspectives on changing the concentrations of reactants and products are worthy of mention. The partial pressure $P$ of an ideal gas is proportional to its molar concentration $M$,

$$
M=\frac{n}{V}=\frac{P}{R T}
$$

and so changes in the partial pressures of any reactant or product are essentially changes in concentrations and thus yield the same effects on equilibria. Aside from adding or removing reactant or product, the pressures (concentrations) of species in a gas-phase equilibrium can also be changed by changing the volume occupied by the system. Since all species of a gas-phase equilibrium occupy the same volume, a given change in volume will cause the same change in concentration for both reactants and products. In order to discern what shift, if any, this type of stress will induce the stoichiometry of the reaction must be considered.

At equilibrium, the reaction $\mathrm{H}_{2}(g)+\mathrm{I}_{2}(g) \rightleftharpoons 2 \mathrm{HI}(g)$ is described by the reaction quotient

$$
Q_{p}=\frac{P_{\mathrm{HI}}^{2}}{P_{\mathrm{I} 2} P_{\mathrm{I} 2}}=K_{p}
$$

If the volume occupied by an equilibrium mixture of these species is decreased by a factor of 3 , the partial pressures of all three species will be increased by a factor of 3 :

$$
\begin{aligned}
& Q_{p}{ }^{\prime}=\frac{\left(3 P_{\mathrm{HI}}\right)^{2}}{3 P_{\mathrm{H} 2} 3 P_{\mathrm{I} 2}}=\frac{9 P_{\mathrm{HI}}{ }^{2}}{9 P_{\mathrm{H} 2} P_{\mathrm{I} 2}}=\frac{P_{\mathrm{HI}}{ }^{2}}{P_{\mathrm{H} 2} P_{\mathrm{I} 2}}=Q_{p}=K_{p} \\
& Q_{p}{ }^{\prime}=Q_{p}=K_{p}
\end{aligned}
$$

And so, changing the volume of this gas-phase equilibrium mixture does not results in a shift of the equilibrium.
A similar treatment of a different system, $2 \mathrm{NO}_{2}(g) \rightleftharpoons 2 \mathrm{NO}(g)+\mathrm{O}_{2}(g)$, however, yields a different result:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& Q_{p}=\frac{P_{\mathrm{NO}^{2}} P_{\mathrm{O} 2}}{P_{\mathrm{NO} 2}{ }^{2}}=K_{p} \\
& Q_{p}{ }^{\prime}=\frac{\left(3 P_{\mathrm{NO}}\right)^{2} 3 P_{\mathrm{O} 2}}{\left(3 P_{\mathrm{NO} 2}\right)^{2}}=\frac{9 P_{\mathrm{NO}^{2}} 3 P_{\mathrm{O} 2}}{9 P_{\mathrm{NO} 2}{ }^{2}}=\frac{27 P_{\mathrm{NO}^{2}} P_{\mathrm{O} 2}}{9 P_{\mathrm{NO} 2}{ }^{2}}=3 Q_{p}>K_{p} \\
& Q_{p}{ }^{\prime}=3 Q_{p}>K_{p}
\end{aligned}
$$

In this case, the change in volume results in a reaction quotient greater than the equilibrium constant, and so the equilibrium will shift left.

These results illustrate the relationship between the stoichiometry of a gas-phase equilibrium and the effect of a volume-induced pressure (concentration) change. If the total molar amounts of reactants and products are equal, as in the first example, a change in volume does not shift the equilibrium. If the molar amounts of reactants and products are different, a change in volume will shift the equilibrium in a direction that better "accommodates" the volume change. In the second example, two moles of reactant $\left(\mathrm{NO}_{2}\right)$ yield three moles of product $\left(2 \mathrm{NO}+\mathrm{O}_{2}\right)$, and so decreasing the system volume causes the equilibrium to shift left since the reverse reaction produces less gas ( 2 mol ) than the forward reaction ( 3 mol ). Conversely, increasing the volume of this equilibrium system would result in a shift towards products.

#### Chemistry in Everyday Life

**Equilibrium and Soft Drinks**

The connection between chemistry and carbonated soft drinks goes back to 1767, when Joseph Priestley (1733-1804) developed a method of infusing water with carbon dioxide to make carbonated water. Priestly's approach involved production of carbon dioxidey reacting oil of vitriol (sulfuric acid) with chalk (calcium carbonate).

The carbon dioxide was then dissolved in water, reacting to produce hydrogen carbonate, a weak acid that subsequently ionized to yield bicarbonate and hydrogen ions:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \text { dissolution } \mathrm{CO}_{2}(g) \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{CO}_{2}(a q) \\
& \text { hydrolysis } \mathrm{CO}_{2}(a q)+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}(l) \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}(a q) \\
& \text { ionization } \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}(a q) \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}(a q)+\mathrm{H}^{+}(a q)
\end{aligned}
$$

These same equilibrium reactions are the basis of today's soft-drink carbonation process. Beverages are exposed to a high pressure of gaseous carbon dioxide during the process to shift the first equilibrium above to the right, resulting in desirably high concentrations of dissolved carbon dioxide and, per similar shifts in the other two equilibria, its hydrolysis and ionization products. A bottle or can is then nearly filled with the carbonated beverage, leaving a relatively small volume of air in the container above the beverage surface (the headspace) before it is sealed. The pressure of carbon dioxide in the container headspace is very low immediately after sealing, but it rises as the dissolution equilibrium is re-established by shifting to the left. Since the volume of the beverage is significantly greater than the volume of the headspace, only a relatively small amount of dissolved carbon dioxide is lost to the headspace.
When a carbonated beverage container is opened, a hissing sound is heard as pressurized $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ escapes from the headspace. This causes the dissolution equilibrium to shift left, resulting in a decrease in the concentration of dissolved $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and subsequent left-shifts of the hydrolysis and ionization equilibria. Fortunately for the consumer, the dissolution equilibrium is usually re-established slowly, and so the beverage may be enjoyed while its dissolved carbon dioxide concentration remains palatably high. Once the equilibria are re-established, the $\mathrm{CO}_{2}(a q)$ concentration will be significantly lowered, and the beverage acquires a characteristic taste referred to as "flat."

![Image](Chapter_13_images/img-6.jpeg)

Figure 13.7 Opening a soft-drink bottle lowers the $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ pressure above the beverage, shifting the dissolution equilibrium and releasing dissolved $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ from the beverage. (credit: modification of work by "D Coetzee'/Flickr)

#### Effect of a Change in Temperature 

Consistent with the law of mass action, an equilibrium stressed by a change in concentration will shift to re-establish equilibrium without any change in the value of the equilibrium constant, $K$. When an equilibrium shifts in response to a temperature change, however, it is re-established with a different relative composition that exhibits a different value for the equilibrium constant.

To understand this phenomenon, consider the elementary reaction

$$
\mathrm{A} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{~B}
$$

Since this is an elementary reaction, the rates laws for the forward and reverse may be derived directly from the balanced equation's stoichiometry:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \operatorname{rate}_{f}=k_{f}[\mathrm{~A}] \\
& \text { rate }_{r}=k_{r}[\mathrm{~B}]
\end{aligned}
$$

When the system is at equilibrium,

$$
\text { rate }_{r}=\text { rate }_{f}
$$

Substituting the rate laws into this equality and rearranging gives

$$
\begin{aligned}
& k_{f}[\mathrm{~A}]=k_{r}[\mathrm{~B}] \\
& \frac{[B]}{[A]}=\frac{k_{f}}{k_{r}}=K_{c}
\end{aligned}
$$

The equilibrium constant is seen to be a mathematical function of the rate constants for the forward and reverse reactions. Since the rate constants vary with temperature as described by the Arrhenius equation, is stands to reason that the equilibrium constant will likewise vary with temperature (assuming the rate constants are affected to different extents by the temperature change). For more complex reactions involving multistep reaction mechanisms, a similar but more complex mathematical relation exists between the equilibrium constant and the rate constants of the steps in the mechanism. Regardless of how complex the reaction may be, the temperature-dependence of its equilibrium constant persists.

Predicting the shift an equilibrium will experience in response to a change in temperature is most conveniently accomplished by considering the enthalpy change of the reaction. For example, the decomposition of dinitrogen tetroxide is an endothermic (heat-consuming) process:

$$
\mathrm{N}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{4}(g) \rightleftharpoons 2 \mathrm{NO}_{2}(g) \quad \Delta H=+57.20 \mathrm{~kJ}
$$

For purposes of applying Le Chatelier's principle, heat (q) may be viewed as a reactant:

$$
\text { heat }+\mathrm{N}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{4}(g) \rightleftharpoons 2 \mathrm{NO}_{2}(g)
$$

Raising the temperature of the system is akin to increasing the amount of a reactant, and so the equilibrium will shift to the right. Lowering the system temperature will likewise cause the equilibrium to shift left. For exothermic processes, heat is viewed as a product of the reaction and so the opposite temperature dependence is observed.

This interactive animation (http://openstaxcollege.org/1/16chatelier) allows you to apply Le Châtelier's principle to predict the effects of changes in concentration, pressure, and temperature on reactant and product concentrations.

#### Effect of a Catalyst

The kinetics chapter of this text identifies a catalyst as a substance that enables a reaction to proceed via a different mechanism with an accelerated rate. The catalyzed reaction mechanism involves a lower energy transition state than the uncatalyzed reaction, resulting in a lower activation energy, $E_{a}$, and a correspondingly greater rate constant.

To discern the effect of catalysis on an equilibrium system, consider the reaction diagram for a simple one-step (elementary) reaction shown in Figure 13.8. The lowered transition state energy of the catalyzed reaction results in lowered activation energies for both the forward and the reverse reactions. Consequently, both forward and reverse

reactions are accelerated, and equilibrium is achieved more quickly but without a change in the equilibrium constant.

![Image](Chapter_13_images/img-7.jpeg)

Figure 13.8 Reaction diagrams for an elementary process in the absence (red) and presence (blue) of a catalyst. The presence of catalyst lowers the activation energies of both the forward and reverse reactions but does not affect the value of the equilibrium constant.

An interesting case study highlighting these equilibrium concepts is the industrial production of ammonia, $\mathrm{NH}_{3}$. This substance is among the "top 10 " industrial chemicals with regard to production, with roughly two billion pounds produced annually in the US. Ammonia is used as a chemical feedstock to synthesize a wide range of commercially useful compounds, including fertilizers, plastics, dyes, and explosives.
Most industrial production of ammonia uses the Haber-Bosch process based on the following equilibrium reaction:

$$
\mathrm{N}_{2}(g)+3 \mathrm{H}_{2}(g) \rightleftharpoons 2 \mathrm{NH}_{3}(g) \quad \Delta H=-92.2 \mathrm{~kJ}
$$

The traits of this reaction present challenges to its use in an efficient industrial process. The equilibrium constant is relatively small ( $K_{p}$ on the order of $10_{-5}$ at $25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ ), meaning very little ammonia is present in an equilibrium mixture. Also, the rate of this reaction is relatively slow at low temperatures. To raise the yield of ammonia, the industrial process is designed to operate under conditions favoring product formation:

- High pressures (concentrations) of reactants are used, $\sim 150-250 \mathrm{~atm}$, to shift the equilibrium right, favoring product formation.
- Ammonia is continually removed (collected) from the equilibrium mixture during the process, lowering its concentration and also shifting the equilibrium right.
- Although low temperatures favor product formation for this exothermic process, the reaction rate at low temperatures is inefficiently slow. A catalyst is used to accelerate the reaction to reasonable rates at relatively moderate temperatures $\left(400-500^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)$.

A diagram illustrating a typical industrial setup for production of ammonia via the Haber-Bosch process is shown in Figure 13.9.

![Image](Chapter_13_images/img-8.jpeg)

Figure 13.9 The figure shows a typical industrial setup for the commercial production of ammonia by the HaberBosch process. The process operates under conditions that stress the chemical equilibrium to favor product formation.

### 13.4 Equilibrium Calculations 

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

- Identify the changes in concentration or pressure that occur for chemical species in equilibrium systems
- Calculate equilibrium concentrations or pressures and equilibrium constants, using various algebraic approaches

Having covered the essential concepts of chemical equilibria in the preceding sections of this chapter, this final section will demonstrate the more practical aspect of using these concepts and appropriate mathematical strategies to perform various equilibrium calculations. These types of computations are essential to many areas of science and technology-for example, in the formulation and dosing of pharmaceutical products. After a drug is ingested or injected, it is typically involved in several chemical equilibria that affect its ultimate concentration in the body system of interest. Knowledge of the quantitative aspects of these equilibria is required to compute a dosage amount that will solicit the desired therapeutic effect.

Many of the useful equilibrium calculations that will be demonstrated here require terms representing changes in reactant and product concentrations. These terms are derived from the stoichiometry of the reaction, as illustrated by decomposition of ammonia:

$$
2 \mathrm{NH}_{3}(g) \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{N}_{2}(g)+3 \mathrm{H}_{2}(g)
$$

As shown earlier in this chapter, this equilibrium may be established within a sealed container that initially contains

either $\mathrm{NH}_{3}$ only, or a mixture of any two of the three chemical species involved in the equilibrium. Regardless of its initial composition, a reaction mixture will show the same relationships between changes in the concentrations of the three species involved, as dictated by the reaction stoichiometry (see also the related content on expressing reaction rates in the chapter on kinetics). For example, if the nitrogen concentration increases by an amount $x$ :

$$
\Delta\left[\mathrm{N}_{2}\right]=+x
$$

the corresponding changes in the other species concentrations are

$$
\begin{gathered}
\Delta\left[\mathrm{H}_{2}\right]=\Delta\left[\mathrm{N}_{2}\right]\left(\frac{3 \mathrm{~mol} \mathrm{H}_{2}}{1 \mathrm{~mol} \mathrm{~N}_{2}}\right)=+3 x \\
\Delta\left[\mathrm{NH}_{3}\right]=-\Delta\left[\mathrm{N}_{2}\right]\left(\frac{2 \mathrm{~mol} \mathrm{NH}_{3}}{1 \mathrm{~mol} \mathrm{~N}_{2}}\right)=-2 x
\end{gathered}
$$

where the negative sign indicates a decrease in concentration.

#### Calculation of an Equilibrium Constant

The equilibrium constant for a reaction is calculated from the equilibrium concentrations (or pressures) of its reactants and products. If these concentrations are known, the calculation simply involves their substitution into the K expression, as was illustrated by Example 13.2. A slightly more challenging example is provided next, in which the reaction stoichiometry is used to derive equilibrium concentrations from the information provided. The basic strategy of this computation is helpful for many types of equilibrium computations and relies on the use of terms for the

reactant and product concentrations initially present, for how they change as the reaction proceeds, and for what they are when the system reaches equilibrium. The acronym ICE is commonly used to refer to this mathematical approach, and the concentrations terms are usually gathered in a tabular format called an ICE table.

#### Example 13.7 

**Calculation of an Equilibrium Constant**

Iodine molecules react reversibly with iodide ions to produce triiodide ions.

$$
\mathrm{I}_{2}(a q)+\mathrm{I}^{-}(a q) \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{I}_{3}{ }^{-}(a q)
$$

If a solution with the concentrations of $\mathrm{I}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{I}^{-}$both equal to $1.000 \times 10^{-3} \mathrm{M}$ before reaction gives an equilibrium concentration of $\mathrm{I}_{2}$ of $6.61 \times 10^{-4} \mathrm{M}$, what is the equilibrium constant for the reaction?

**Solution**

To calculate the equilibrium constants, equilibrium concentrations are needed for all the reactants and products:

$$
K_{C}=\frac{\left[\mathrm{I}^{3-}\right]}{\left[\mathrm{I}_{2}\right]\left[\mathrm{I}^{-}\right]}
$$

Provided are the initial concentrations of the reactants and the equilibrium concentration of the product. Use this information to derive terms for the equilibrium concentrations of the reactants, presenting all the information in an ICE table.

![Image](Chapter_13_images/img-16.png)

At equilibrium the concentration of $\mathrm{I}_{2}$ is $6.61 \times 10^{-4} M$ so that

$$
\begin{gathered}
1.000 \times 10^{-3}-x=6.61 \times 10^{-4} \\
x=1.000 \times 10^{-3}-6.61 \times 10^{-4} \\
=3.39 \times 10^{-4} \mathrm{M}
\end{gathered}
$$

The ICE table may now be updated with numerical values for all its concentrations:

![Image](Chapter_13_images/img-17.png)

Finally, substitute the equilibrium concentrations into the $K$ expression and solve:

$$
\begin{gathered}
K_{c}=\frac{\left[\mathrm{I}_{3}{ }^{-}\right]}{\left[\mathrm{I}_{2}\right]\left[\mathrm{I}^{-}\right]} \\
=\frac{3.39 \times 10^{-4} M}{\left(6.61 \times 10^{-4} M\right)\left(6.61 \times 10^{-4} M\right)}=776
\end{gathered}

#### Calculation of a Missing Equilibrium Concentration 

When the equilibrium constant and all but one equilibrium concentration are provided, the other equilibrium concentration(s) may be calculated. A computation of this sort is illustrated in the next example exercise.

#### Example 13.8

**Calculation of a Missing Equilibrium Concentration**

Nitrogen oxides are air pollutants produced by the reaction of nitrogen and oxygen at high temperatures. At $2000^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, the value of the $K_{c}$ for the reaction, $\mathrm{N}_{2}(g)+\mathrm{O}_{2}(g) \rightleftharpoons 2 \mathrm{NO}(g)$, is $4.1 \times 10^{-4}$. Calculate the equilibrium concentration of $\mathrm{NO}(g)$ in air at 1 atm pressure and $2000^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. The equilibrium concentrations of $\mathrm{N}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ at this pressure and temperature are 0.036 M and 0.0089 M , respectively.

**Solution**

Substitute the provided quantities into the equilibrium constant expression and solve for [NO]:

$$K_{c}=\frac{[\mathrm{NO}]^{2}}{\left[\mathrm{~N}_{2}\right]\left[\mathrm{O}_{2}\right]}$$

$$[\mathrm{NO}]^{2}=K_{c}\left[\mathrm{~N}_{2}\right]\left[\mathrm{O}_{2}\right]$$

$$[\mathrm{NO}]=\sqrt{K_{c}\left[\mathrm{~N}_{2}\right]\left[\mathrm{O}_{2}\right]}$$

$$=\sqrt{\left(4.1 \times 10^{-4}\right)(0.036)(0.0089)}$$

$$=\sqrt{1.31 \times 10^{-7}}$$

$$=3.6 \times 10^{-4}$$

Thus $[\mathrm{NO}]$ is $3.6 \times 10^{-4} \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{L}$ at equilibrium under these conditions.
To confirm this result, it may be used along with the provided equilibrium concentrations to calculate a value for $K$ :

$$
\begin{gathered}
K_{c}=\frac{[\mathrm{NO}]^{2}}{\left[\mathrm{~N}_{2}\right]\left[\mathrm{O}_{2}\right]} \\
=\frac{\left(3.6 \times 10^{-4}\right)^{2}}{(0.036)(0.0089)} \\
=4.0 \times 10^{-4}
\end{gathered}
$$

This result is consistent with the provided value for $K$ within nominal uncertainty, differing by just 1 in the least significant digit's place.

Answer: $1.53 \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{L}$

#### Calculation of Equilibrium Concentrations from Initial Concentrations

Perhaps the most challenging type of equilibrium calculation can be one in which equilibrium concentrations are derived from initial concentrations and an equilibrium constant. For these calculations, a four-step approach is typically useful:

1. Identify the direction in which the reaction will proceed to reach equilibrium.
2. Develop an ICE table.
3. Calculate the concentration changes and, subsequently, the equilibrium concentrations.
4. Confirm the calculated equilibrium concentrations.

The last two example exercises of this chapter demonstrate the application of this strategy.

#### Example 13.9

**Calculation of Equilibrium Concentrations**

Under certain conditions, the equilibrium constant $K_{\mathrm{c}}$ for the decomposition of $\mathrm{PCl}_{5}(g)$ into $\mathrm{PCl}_{3}(g)$ and $\mathrm{Cl}_{2}(g)$ is 0.0211 . What are the equilibrium concentrations of $\mathrm{PCl}_{5}, \mathrm{PCl}_{3}$, and $\mathrm{Cl}_{2}$ in a mixture that initially contained only $\mathrm{PCl}_{5}$ at a concentration of 1.00 M ?

**Solution**

Use the stepwise process described earlier.
Step 1. Determine the direction the reaction proceeds.
The balanced equation for the decomposition of $\mathrm{PCl}_{5}$ is

$$
\mathrm{PCl}_{5}(g) \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{PCl}_{3}(g)+\mathrm{Cl}_{2}(g)
$$

Because only the reactant is present initially $Q_{c}=0$ and the reaction will proceed to the right.
Step 2. Develop an ICE table.

![Image](Chapter_13_images/img-18.png)

Step 3. Solve for the change and the equilibrium concentrations.
Substituting the equilibrium concentrations into the equilibrium constant equation gives

$$
\begin{gathered}
K_{c}=\frac{\left[\mathrm{PCl}_{3}\right]\left[\mathrm{Cl}_{2}\right]}{\left[\mathrm{PCl}_{5}\right]}=0.0211 \\
=\frac{(x)(x)}{(1.00-x)} \\
0.0211=\frac{(x)(x)}{(1.00-x)} \\
0.0211(1.00-x)=x^{2} \\
x^{2}+0.0211 x-0.0211=0
\end{gathered}
$$

Appendix B shows an equation of the form $a x^{2}+b x+c=0$ can be rearranged to solve for $x$ :

$$
x=\frac{-b \pm 1 / b^{2}-4 a c}{2 a}
$$

In this case, $a=1, b=0.0211$, and $c=-0.0211$. Substituting the appropriate values for $a, b$, and $c$ yields:

$$
\begin{gathered}
x=\frac{-0.0211 \pm 1 /(0.0211)^{2}-4(1)(-0.0211)}{2(1)} \\
=\frac{-0.0211 \pm 1 /\left(4.45 \times 10^{-4}\right)+\left(8.44 \times 10^{-2}\right)}{2} \\
=\frac{-0.0211 \pm 0.291}{2}
\end{gathered}
$$

The two roots of the quadratic are, therefore,

$$
x=\frac{-0.0211+0.291}{2}=0.135
$$

and

$$
x=\frac{-0.0211-0.291}{2}=-0.156
$$

For this scenario, only the positive root is physically meaningful (concentrations are either zero or positive), and so $x=0.135 M$.

The equilibrium concentrations are

$$
\begin{gathered}
{\left[\mathrm{PCl}_{5}\right]=1.00-0.135=0.87 M} \\
{\left[\mathrm{PCl}_{3}\right]=x=0.135 M} \\
{\left[\mathrm{Cl}_{2}\right]=x=0.135 M}
\end{gathered}
$$

Step 4. Confirm the calculated equilibrium concentrations.
Substitution into the expression for $K_{c}$ (to check the calculation) gives

$$
K_{c}=\frac{\left[\mathrm{PCl}_{3}\right]\left[\mathrm{Cl}_{2}\right]}{\left[\mathrm{PCl}_{5}\right]}=\frac{(0.135)(0.135)}{0.87}=0.021
$$

The equilibrium constant calculated from the equilibrium concentrations is equal to the value of $K_{c}$ given in the problem (when rounded to the proper number of significant figures).

#### Example 13.10 

**Calculation of Equilibrium Concentrations Using an Algebra-Simplifying Assumption**

What are the concentrations at equilibrium of a 0.15 M solution of HCN?

$$
\operatorname{HCN}(a q) \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{H}^{+}(a q)+\mathrm{CN}^{-}(a q) \quad K_{c}=4.9 \times 10^{-10}
$$

**Solution**

Using " $x$ " to represent the concentration of each product at equilibrium gives this ICE table.

![Image](Chapter_13_images/img-19.png)

Substitute the equilibrium concentration terms into the $K_{c}$ expression

$$
K_{c}=\frac{(x)(x)}{0.15-x}
$$

rearrange to the quadratic form and solve for $x$

$$
\begin{gathered}
x^{2}+4.9 \times 10^{-10}-7.35 \times 10^{-11}=0 \\
x=8.56 \times 10^{-6} M(3 \text { sig. figs })=8.6 \times 10^{-6} M(2 \text { sig. figs })
\end{gathered}
$$

Thus $\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]=\left[\mathrm{CN}^{-}\right]=x=8.6 \times 10^{-6} \mathrm{M}$ and $[\mathrm{HCN}]=0.15-x=0.15 \mathrm{M}$.
Note in this case that the change in concentration is significantly less than the initial concentration (a consequence of the small $K$ ), and so the initial concentration experiences a negligible change:

$$
\text { if } x \ll 0.15 \mathrm{M}, \text { then }(0.15-x) \approx 0.15
$$

This approximation allows for a more expedient mathematical approach to the calculation that avoids the need to solve for the roots of a quadratic equation:

$$
\begin{gathered}
K_{c}=\frac{(x)(x)}{0.15-x} \approx \frac{x^{2}}{0.15} \\
4.9 \times 10^{-10}=\frac{x^{2}}{0.15} \\
x^{2}=(0.15)\left(4.9 \times 10^{-10}\right)=7.4 \times 10^{-11} \\
x=\sqrt{7.4 \times 10^{-11}}=8.6 \times 10^{-6} \mathrm{M}
\end{gathered}
$$

The value of $x$ calculated is, indeed, much less than the initial concentration

$$
8.6 \times 10^{-6} \ll 0.15
$$

and so the approximation was justified. If this simplified approach were to yield a value for $x$ that did not

justify the approximation, the calculation would need to be repeated without making the approximation.

### Summary

#### 13.1 Chemical Equilibria

A reversible reaction is at equilibrium when the forward and reverse processes occur at equal rates. Chemical equilibria are dynamic processes characterized by constant amounts of reactant and product species.

#### 13.2 Equilibrium Constants

The composition of a reaction mixture may be represented by a mathematical function known as the reaction quotient, Q. For a reaction at equilibrium, the composition is constant, and $Q$ is called the equilibrium constant, $K$.

A homogeneous equilibrium is an equilibrium in which all components are in the same phase. A heterogeneous equilibrium is an equilibrium in which components are in two or more phases.

#### 13.3 Shifting Equilibria: Le Châtelier's Principle

Systems at equilibrium can be disturbed by changes to temperature, concentration, and, in some cases, volume and pressure. The system's response to these disturbances is described by Le Châtelier's principle: An equilibrium system subjected to a disturbance will shift in a way that counters the disturbance and re-establishes equilibrium. A catalyst will increase the rate of both the forward and reverse reactions of a reversible process, increasing the rate at which

equilibrium is reached but not altering the equilibrium mixture's composition ( $K$ does not change).

#### 13.4 Equilibrium Calculations 

Calculating values for equilibrium constants and/or equilibrium concentrations is of practical benefit to many applications. A mathematical strategy that uses initial concentrations, changes in concentrations, and equilibrium concentrations (and goes by the acronym ICE) is useful for several types of equilibrium calculations.

$\mathrm{CaCO}_{3}(s) \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{CaO}(s)+\mathrm{CO}_{2}(g)$
82. The equilibrium constant $\left(K_{c}\right)$ for this reaction is 1.60 at $990^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ :
$\mathrm{H}_{2}(g)+\mathrm{CO}_{2}(g) \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}(g)+\mathrm{CO}(g)$

83. In a $3.0-\mathrm{L}$ vessel, the following equilibrium partial pressures are measured: $\mathrm{N}_{2}, 190$ torr; $\mathrm{H}_{2}, 317$ torr; $\mathrm{NH}_{3}$, $1.00 \times 10^{3}$ torr.
$\mathrm{N}_{2}(g)+3 \mathrm{H}_{2}(g) \rightleftharpoons 2 \mathrm{NH}_{3}(g)$
(a) How will the partial pressures of $\mathrm{H}_{2}, \mathrm{~N}_{2}$, and $\mathrm{NH}_{3}$ change if $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ is removed from the system? Will they increase, decrease, or remain the same?
(b) Hydrogen is removed from the vessel until the partial pressure of nitrogen, at equilibrium, is 250 torr. Calculate the partial pressures of the other substances under the new conditions.
84. The equilibrium constant $\left(K_{c}\right)$ for this reaction is 5.0 at a given temperature.
$\mathrm{CO}(g)+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}(g) \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{CO}_{2}(g)+\mathrm{H}_{2}(g)$
(a) On analysis, an equilibrium mixture of the substances present at the given temperature was found to contain 0.20 mol of $\mathrm{CO}, 0.30 \mathrm{~mol}$ of water vapor, and 0.90 mol of $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ in a liter. How many moles of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ were there in the equilibrium mixture?
(b) Maintaining the same temperature, additional $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ was added to the system, and some water vapor was removed by drying. A new equilibrium mixture was thereby established containing 0.40 mol of $\mathrm{CO}, 0.30 \mathrm{~mol}$ of water vapor, and 1.2 mol of $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ in a liter. How many moles of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ were in the new equilibrium mixture? Compare this with the quantity in part (a), and discuss whether the second value is reasonable. Explain how it is possible for the water vapor concentration to be the same in the two equilibrium solutions even though some vapor was removed before the second equilibrium was established.

(b) How must the concentration of $\mathrm{NH}_{3}$ change to reach equilibrium if the reaction quotient is less than the equilibrium constant?
(c) If the reaction were at equilibrium, how would an increase in the volume of the reaction vessel affect the pressure of $\mathrm{NO}_{2}$ ?
(d) If the change in the pressure of $\mathrm{NO}_{2}$ is 28 torr as a mixture of the four gases reaches equilibrium, how much will the pressure of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ change?
87. The binding of oxygen by hemoglobin $(\mathrm{Hb})$, giving oxyhemoglobin $\left(\mathrm{HbO}_{2}\right)$, is partially regulated by the concentration of $\mathrm{H}_{3} \mathrm{O}^{+}$and dissolved $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ in the blood. Although the equilibrium is complicated, it can be summarized as

$$
\mathrm{HbO}_{2}(a q)+\mathrm{H}_{3} \mathrm{O}^{+}(a q)+\mathrm{CO}_{2}(g) \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{CO}_{2}-\mathrm{Hb}-\mathrm{H}^{+}+\mathrm{O}_{2}(g)+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}(l)
$$

(b) Explain why the production of lactic acid and $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ in a muscle during exertion stimulates release of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ from the oxyhemoglobin in the blood passing through the muscle.
88. Liquid $\mathrm{N}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3}$ is dark blue at low temperatures, but the color fades and becomes greenish at higher temperatures as the compound decomposes to NO and $\mathrm{NO}_{2}$. At $25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, a value of $K_{P}=1.91$ has been established for this decomposition. If 0.236 moles of $\mathrm{N}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3}$ are placed in a $1.52-\mathrm{L}$ vessel at $25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, calculate the equilibrium partial pressures of $\mathrm{N}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3}(g), \mathrm{NO}_{2}(g)$, and $\mathrm{NO}(g)$.

How many moles of hydrogen must be removed from the vessel to increase the concentration of nitrogen to 1.1 M ? The equilibrium reaction is
$\mathrm{N}_{2}(g)+3 \mathrm{H}_{2}(g) \rightleftharpoons 2 \mathrm{NH}_{3}(g)$
